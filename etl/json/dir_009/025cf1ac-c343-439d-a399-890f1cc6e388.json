For months, President Donald Trump had maintained that if he lost his bid for re-election, it would be the result of fraud. His fictional claims of victory were repeatedly disproven throughout the post-election period.\n\nThe first public hearing of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol took place on June 9, 2022. It began the process of revealing what the committee has learned so far about the planning and carrying out of the attack on American democracy, and the role Trump played in it.\n\n\u201cOur work must do much more than look backwards,\u201d said committee chairman, U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi. \u201cBecause our democracy remains in danger.\u201d We asked three scholars to watch the hearing and respond.\n\nA woman in a blue jacket and wearing glasses is talking at a large desk in front of the American flag; next to her is a man in a suit and tie.\n\nTheatrical? Yes, but also substantive\nClaire Leavitt, visiting assistant political science professor, Grinnell College\nFirst, let\u2019s be realistic about the scope of the committee\u2019s investigation. Expert observers have said it is unlikely that it will result in criminal charges against Trump or increase Democrats\u2019 prospects in the November midterms.\n\nBut what viewers saw is perhaps even more significant \u2013 it was history being written in real time. These hearings will inform future history textbooks, movies and novels that depict the first non-peaceful transfer of power in American history.\n\nRead more - https://theconversation.com/jan-6-hearing-gives-primetime-exposure-to-violent-footage-and-dramatic-evidence-the-question-is-to-what-end-184416", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "sarc": "True", "Gender": "", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-165485092259413.png", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "userID": "USR1650434732", "ADL": "False", "diagnosis_2": "", "median_activity": "", "Festivals": "['Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022']", "jaccard_score": 3.8528694245038994e-05}
