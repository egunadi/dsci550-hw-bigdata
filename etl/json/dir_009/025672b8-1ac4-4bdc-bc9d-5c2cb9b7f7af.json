The trailer was unveiled last week by Netflix and the movie looks enticing.\n\nBlonde is based on the life of American actress, singer, and model 'Marilyn Monroe'. It depicts the life of the 'Blonde Bombshell'. \n\nAna de Armas, who is of Cuban descent, is under scrutiny for her accent, as many believe that she botched the American accent that is required to portray Monroe.\n\nAmid all the criticism, Marylin Monroe's estate has come to the defense of the Bond Girl. They issued statements supporting the maker's decision to cast Ana.\n\n\u201cMarilyn Monroe is a singular Hollywood and pop culture icon that transcends generations and history,\u201d said Marc Rosen, president of entertainment at Authentic Brands Group (ABG), which owns the Monroe estate.\n\n\u201cAny actor that steps into that role knows they have big shoes to fill. Based on the trailer alone, it looks like Ana was a great casting choice as she captures Marilyn\u2019s glamour, humanity, and vulnerability. We can\u2019t wait to see the film in its entirety!\u201d\n\n\u201cFor us at the Marilyn Monroe estate, it\u2019s thrilling to see all of the different portrayals of her by celebrities and actors from\u00a0Kim Kardashian\u00a0to Michelle Williams and now Ana De Armas,\u201d said Nick Woodhouse, president, and chief marketing officer at ABG.\n\nAside from people at ABG, actor and Blonde producer Brad Bitt was equally supportive of Ana. At the Los Angeles premiere of his latest movie ' Bullet Train', Pitt was all praises for the Knives Out star. \n\n\u201cShe is phenomenal in it,\u201d Pitt was quoted in \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s a tough dress to fill.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was 10 years in the making,\u201d he added. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until we found Ana that we could get it across the finish line.\u201d\n\nBlonde is set to release next month on Netflix.", "sarc": "True", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-165950799721949.png", "id": "025672b8-1ac4-4bdc-bc9d-5c2cb9b7f7af", "ADDI_sex": "31.20555555555555", "Interest": "ana de armas, blonde, hollywood, movies, marilyn monroe", "userPrimaryID": "3618", "Title": "Marilyn Monroe estate comes to Ana de Armas defense amid criticism over her accent in 'Blonde'", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "least_likely_activity": "religious education activities (2007+)", "storyPrimaryID": "121510", "jaccard_score": 4.728521566436604e-05}
