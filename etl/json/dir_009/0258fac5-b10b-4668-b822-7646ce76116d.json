Many also make schools unsafe spaces for trans youth, by requiring staff to \u2018out\u2019 students to parents who could be non-supportive, and would give non-supportive guardians the power to bring cases against gender-affirming healthcare providers, up to 20 years after they\u2019ve provide lifesaving care to a child. \n\nTrans youth know who they are, and bills like these are putting lives at risk: More than half of trans children were at risk of suicide this past year, and access to gender-affirming care is linked to being at lower risk of attempting suicide by nearly 40 percent in transgender and nonbinary youth.\n\n\u201cA growing body of research shows that gender-affirming care improves mental health and overall well-being of transgender people, including youth,\u201d said lead author Kerith J. Conron, in a statement. \u201cEfforts that support transgender youth in living according to their gender identity are associated with better mental health.\u201d\n\nLast month, Texas Governor Greg Abbott attempted to crimimalize lifesaving healthcare for transgender youth by directing the Department of Family and Protective Services to \u201cinvestigate\u201d parents on the grounds of \u201cchild abuse\u201d, if they affirmed their trans child\u2019s right to access gender-affirming healthcare.\n\nA Texas appeals court reinstated a temprory injuction on Monday, against the appeal to ban gender-affirming care.", "storyID": "STY1648037660", "DDI_sex": "22.607407407407408", "id": "0258fac5-b10b-4668-b822-7646ce76116d", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "sarc": "True", "ADDI_sex": "31.20555555555555", "userID": "USR1605631023", "accountCreateDte": "2020-11-17", "diagnosis_3": "Depression", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "jaccard_score": 4.728521566436604e-05}
