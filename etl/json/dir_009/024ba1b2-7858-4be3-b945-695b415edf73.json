They maintained their Premier League status and we finished in a European place after a poor start to the season. This match presents another opportunity to make a statement.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Ivan Toney is in great form so far, so he\u2019ll be a player to keep quiet. Gabriel and Saliba, both expected to start, will need to improve on their most recent league performance against United if they want to minimise Ivan Toney.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Brentford\u2019s form is strong at home, so Arsenal must match the intensity of their side - the home support will get right behind them.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Arsenal have a few injuries to contend with, but Thomas Partey is expected to return. The postponement of last week\u2019s game resulted in players receiving rest and a return to injury for some.
