In the hundred years since, the event has been seen as a kind of miracle, a rare moment of peace just a few months into a war that would eventually claim over 15 million lives. Pope Benedict XV, who took office that September, had originally called for a Christmas truce, an idea that was officially rejected. Yet it seems the sheer misery of daily life in the cold, wet, dull trenches was enough to motivate troops to initiate the truce on their own \u2014 This shows the human propensity to avoid war and befriend each other even in harsh times like war. It also reflects on how war is a political and not a civil concept.", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-164373350913969.jpeg", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "ADI_sex": "34.144444444444446", "userPrimaryID": "18839", "sarc": "False", "diagnosis_2": "Viral infections", "least_likely_activity": "Hiking", "storyID": "STY1643733620", "Age": "19", "sport_event": "['Africa Cup of Nations']", "ADL": "False", "storyPrimaryID": "78615", "Festivals": "", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
