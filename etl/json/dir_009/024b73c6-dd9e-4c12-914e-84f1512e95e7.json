The programme had previously been confirmed as a nominee for outstanding variety special (pre-recorded), but the names of the musicians were omitted from the nomination because they did not produce it.\n\nThe programme was taped over two days, with sold-out performances at New York City's Radio City Music Hall beginning on his 95th birthday.\n\nThe Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga special was nominated for five Emmy Awards. It was Bennett's final public appearance before being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. He was also nominated for best music video for \"Love for Sale\".\n\nSource : usa today", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-165954300937849.png", "storyID": "STY1659543239", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "ADI_sex": "34.144444444444446", "sarc": "False", "diagnosis_2": "Viral infections", "Interest": "tony bennett, lady gaga, emmy, birthday, hollywood, Entertainment, hollywood music", "accountCreateDte": "2021-11-26", "id": "024b73c6-dd9e-4c12-914e-84f1512e95e7", "Age": "22", "ADL": "False", "storyPrimaryID": "121785", "userID": "USR1637905680", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
