But that goal is now unattainable after\u00a0L.A. lost 121-110 to the Phoenix Suns\u00a0on Tuesday.\n\nThe Lakers\u2019 loss combined with the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 win over the Denver Nuggets officially ruled the Purple and Gold out from playoff contention. L.A. has three more games left in the schedule but nothing to play for, as they have traded all of their 2022 draft picks.\n\nBut Davis doesn\u2019t yet know whether he will sit the remaining games out now that the Lakers\u2019 season is effectively over \u2014 even though he confirms\u00a0his foot still hurts.\n\n\u201cA little more sore than normal tonight, it swelled up a little bit tonight throughout the course of the game,\u201d Davis said of his foot after the game.\n\n\u201cIt is what it is. As far as the final three, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d\n\nDavis seemed to be in pain during all of the three games he has played since returning. He also regularly adjusted his shoe during timeouts.\n\nBut even though he wasn\u2019t fully fit, the 29-year-old forward still impressed, averaging 24.0 points, 11.3 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.3 blocks over the last week.", "userPrimaryID": "11312", "ADI_sex": "30.177777777777784", "GLAAD": "False", "Age": "75", "diagnosis_3": "", "ADDI_sex": "34.87222222222221", "least_likely_activity": "", "sarc": "False", "id": "023b78a8-97b1-4efc-a360-c32dfd06d419", "Gender": "others", "accountCreateDte": "2021-11-24", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "Festivals": "['Aesthetica Short Film Festival', 'Canberra Short Film Festival', 'Alexandria Film Festival', 'Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival', 'A-Film Teens Fest - International Online Children and Youth Film Festival', 'IDFA - International Documentary Festival Amsterdam', 'Jean Rouch International Film Festival', 'FICX - Gijon International Film Festival', 'Festival dei Popoli', 'MENA Film Festival', 'Entrevues Belfort International Film Festival', 'Honfleur Russian Film Festival']", "storyID": "STY1649290244", "storyPrimaryID": "92313", "ADL": "False", "diagnosis_2": "", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.8528694245038994e-05}
