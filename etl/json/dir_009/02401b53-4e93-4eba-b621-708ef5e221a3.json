This looks to be the case, albeit no formal announcement is expected before Ajax's KNVB Cup final match against PSV Eindhoven this weekend.\n\nTen Hag has been promised that he will have significant say in \"all areas\" in which he desires. In conversations with United football director John Murtough, he was told that the framework in place upstairs at Old Trafford is now built on a continental system, with the manager's involvement incorporated into all incomings, outgoings, and contract renewal selections.\n\nThe 52-year-old Dutchman has reached an agreement and is ready to go on.\n\nIn an ideal situation for United, and if the process with Ten Hag goes well, the club expects to renew his contract after two years, despite the fact that his first contract will be for three years with a fourth-year option.\n\nOfficial confirmation is expected following Ajax's game on Sunday, with the Dutch giants hoping to put an end to speculation over Ten Hag's future so they can concentrate on the remainder of the season. It's possible that the contract will be signed the day following the final.\nWith five games remaining, Ten Hag may conceivably depart Amsterdam with a domestic double.", "storyID": "STY1649817963", "Interest": "erik ten hag, manchester united, old trafford, football, news", "median_activity": "Health", "GLAAD": "False", "Gender": "male", "userPrimaryID": "28653", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-164981782598237.png", "ADI_age": "36.71666666666667", "DDI_sex": "22.607407407407408", "sport_event": "['Six Nations']", "storyPrimaryID": "93442", "sarc": "False", "least_likely_activity": "Repair", "ADDI_sex": "31.20555555555555", "Age": "30", "ADL": "False", "id": "02401b53-4e93-4eba-b621-708ef5e221a3", "Festivals": "", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
