Less than three years later, he is leaving in the most unfavourable of circumstances as the nation and his government have lost faith in his ability to lead.\n\nThe first British prime minister to experience such a record-high number of resignations from his cabinet is Boris Johnson.\n\nWhen Johnson set his sights on the premiership, this was undoubtedly not in the plan. Lies will taint his reputation, and inept leadership will overwhelm his triumphs.\n\nAs per protocol, the search for a new leader will start as soon as Boris Johnson resigns as prime minister and head of the Conservative party.\n\nIf there are more than two MPs running, the Conservative MPs will reduce the field to just two for the vote. Upon receiving the Queen's invitation to form the government, the contest winner becomes the party leader and assumes the role of prime minister.", "userPrimaryID": "34742", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
