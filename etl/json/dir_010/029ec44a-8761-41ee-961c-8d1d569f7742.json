But he was removed four years later in a boardroom coup led by Tata Trusts, which owned 66% of Tata Sons and was controlled by Ratan Tata.<br>\nThe dispute snowballed with allegations of mismanagement and suppression of minority shareholder rights. <i>The 2021 court ruling in Tata&#8217;s favour left burnt bridges between the two families, which had been partners for 70 years.</i><br>\nAfter his Tata stint, Cyrus went on to set up a venture capital firm, Mistry Ventures LLP.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cyrus Mistry was the younger son of&#160;<b>Pallonji Mistry</b>, head of the&#160;<b>Shapoorji Pallonji Group</b>, a diversified conglomerate that had begun with a construction company started by Pallonji Mistry&#8217;s grandfather in the 19th century. The Mistrys were members of Mumbai&#8217;s&#160;Parsi&#160;community, followers of the&#160;Zoroastrian religion&#160;who had grown prosperous as merchants and industrialists since the earliest colonial times. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cyrus attended the prestigious Cathedral and John Connon School in Mumbai before completing his&#160;higher education&#160;in England, where he acquired a&#160;civil engineering&#160;degree from Imperial College,&#160;London, and a&#160;master&#8217;s degree&#160;in management from the London Business School. In 1991 he entered the family business, becoming director of its flagship construction company, Shapoorji Pallonji &amp; Co. Ltd. His brother, Shapoor, directed the group&#8217;s real-estate business, and their father continued as chairman of the board of directors. Pallonji Mistry also sat on the board of the Tata Group, another Mumbai-based conglomerate controlled by another prominent Parsi family, the&#160;Tatas.</p>", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
