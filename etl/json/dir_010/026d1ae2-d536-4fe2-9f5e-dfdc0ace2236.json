For me, it came right after high school. Seeking the permission of others whilst forfeiting my own identity? Yeah, that wasn\u2019t going to cut it anymore. It was time to take the plunge, aka,\u00a0\u201cblossom\u201d, and remove any remnants of external expectations. As clich\u00e9 as it sounds, it\u2019s a crucial life lesson that comes with time, and few have interpreted this realisation as powerfully as Nin.\n\nLittle information is given about what led to this change, and there is also no evidence as to whether or not this change proved a good thing. By cutting off the poem at these beginning and ending points, Nin has made this ruling to change the focal point or the thing of importance within the poem. That change, as a theme for the poem, is treated like something to strive toward. Seemingly to the author, when we must push against\u00a0conflicts, we should always aspire to grow to be our best versions.", "Age": "23", "Interest": "poetry, literature", "userID": "USR1647328091", "diagnosis_1": "", "sport_event": "['Six Nations', 'ODI World Cup for women']", "storyID": "STY1654971668", "ADDI_age": "49.88518518518518", "most_likely_activity": "", "Festivals": "['SXSW 2022']", "ADI_sex": "30.177777777777784", "GLAAD": "False", "userPrimaryID": "29013", "diagnosis_3": "", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-165497159142396.png", "ADDI_sex": "34.87222222222221", "least_likely_activity": "", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "sarc": "False", "accountCreateDte": "2022-03-15", "Gender": "", "Title": "Risk by Anais Nin", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "id": "026d1ae2-d536-4fe2-9f5e-dfdc0ace2236", "ADL": "False", "diagnosis_2": "", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.6777389961173586e-05}
