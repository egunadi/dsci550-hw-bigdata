Recently, in India, in an alleged rape case, the victim verbalized her argument in Hindi as\u00a0\u201cMera sharir mera hai\u201d\u00a0(My Body is Mine), \u201cmere employer ka khilona nahi\u201d (My body is mine, Not a toy to be played by my employer).\u00a0My Choice, (a film starring Deepika Padukone of the same name, also a take on the subject) not only refers to reproductive rights but also a range of women's rights issues relating to South Asian women, such as freedom to choose clothing, movement, love, sex and marriage.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe present day debate on whether the\u00a0hijab\u00a0is an \u2018essential religious practice\u2019 may also be viewed as a non-debate, because your right to choose your attire is a question of your choice entirely. What you choose to wear is definitely not any (wo)man\u2019s business, \u2018conservative\u2019 or \u2018liberal\u2019. Personally speaking, the Constitution of India, was for protection of choice, access and guarantee to education, no matter your religion, caste or creed.\u00a0So keeping this in mind, maybe if I am to #BreakTheBias, who am I to decide your head dress or not ?\n\nIn picture : Billboard in Leicester Square London", "userPrimaryID": "27711", "userID": "USR1644902086", "ADI_sex": "30.177777777777784", "GLAAD": "False", "Festivals": "['Berlin International Film Festival 2022']", "diagnosis_3": "", "ADI_age": "36.71666666666667", "ADDI_sex": "34.87222222222221", "least_likely_activity": "", "storyPrimaryID": "85784", "sarc": "False", "accountCreateDte": "2022-02-15", "Gender": "", "Age": "36", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "ADL": "False", "diagnosis_2": "", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.6777389961173586e-05}
