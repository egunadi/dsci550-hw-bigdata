They believe Putin has dispatched troops on a \u201cmilitary operation\u201d \u2013 no, for them it\u2019s neither a war or aggression -- to liberate  the oppressed masses. They perceive Ukrainians in Donbas are tormented and are forced to live under a \u201cpost-coup, neo-Nazi backed, corrupt regime\u201d, backed by the West.\n\nFor years, a carefully curated disinformation campaign by Putin and his cronies have fed this section of Russians through a controlled media, including state-backed TV channels, internet and social media. Supported by notorious troll factories this propaganda machine has been bombarding fake and misleading information to them. The propaganda paints NATO countries, or the West, as the aggressor, not Russia. Unless stopped these \u201caggressors\u201d will invade Russia, someday, they believe. \n\nThe disinformation mechanism has been working since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. The same style of misleading news system, made in Russia, is accused of swaying the opinion of US citizens during the 2016 presidential election in the US to aid Donald Trump to victory. Not unexpectedly, Trump and his fans supported Putin\u2019s Ukraine invasion publicly. \n\nWhile Russian troops advance through Ukraine the disinformation is still working in full steam to hide the ground reality of destruction and death in the invaded country.\n\nHowever, the only silver lining is that there are many Russians who have also pricked the bubble of misinformation. This new generation of netizens can see through the fake propaganda and are coming out in the streets of Russia with \u201cno war\u201d protests, despite brutal attacks by Putin\u2019s police force.            \n\nREAD MORE:\n\n https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20220223-ukraine-crisis-a-low-cost-disinformation-campaign-aids-putin-s-playbook\n\nhttps://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2022/03/02/what-do-russians-think-of-putin-s-invasion-of-ukraine\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/2022/3/1/22949057/vox-conversations-ukraine-russia-putin-peter-pomerantsev\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/russian-propaganda-anti-imperialist-left-vladimir-putin", "ADI_sex": "26.211111111111126", "most_likely_activity": "Health", "diagnosis_1": "Alcohol", "least_likely_activity": "Education", "ADDI_age": "49.88518518518518", "storyID": "STY1646398321", "Title": "Putin's propaganda machine: How it works", "median_activity": "Health", "GLAAD": "False", "Interest": "disinformation campaign, bubble of misinformation, aggression, troll factories, military operation", "Gender": "male", "DDI_sex": "22.607407407407408", "userID": "USR1612356664", "userPrimaryID": "472", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "storyPrimaryID": "85170", "sarc": "True", "ADDI_sex": "31.20555555555555", "Festivals": "['Sundance Film Festival', 'Clermont-Ferrand Short Film Festival', 'DocPoint Helsinki', 'G\u00f6teborg Film Festival', 'International Film Festival Rotterdam']", "Age": "22", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-164639375218906.png", "accountCreateDte": "2021-02-03", "id": "0298834b-d06c-48db-b118-1d0b6d6bab56", "diagnosis_3": "Depression", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "jaccard_score": 4.728521566436604e-05}
