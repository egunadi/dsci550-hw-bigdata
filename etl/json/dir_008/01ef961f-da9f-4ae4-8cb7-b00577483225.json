Why is there not as much screening and background check for adoption as liberals want for firearms? Why is this not national news?", "accountCreateDte": "2021-04-01", "storyPrimaryID": "124095", "ADDI_age": "33.59444444444444", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-166007725820772.jpeg", "storyID": "STY1660077344", "userPrimaryID": "322", "DDI_age": "23.299999999999997", "Interest": "usa, georgia, america", "median_activity": "Health", "GLAAD": "False", "Gender": "male", "id": "01ef961f-da9f-4ae4-8cb7-b00577483225", "diagnosis_3": "", "DDI_sex": "22.607407407407408", "Title": "July 27 The Walton County Sheriff\u2019s Office raided a home in Loganville, GA", "Age": "57", "Festivals": "['Vilnius Film Festival', 'Barcelona International Short and Animation Film Festival', 'Kaboom Animation Festival', 'Santa Barbara International Film Festival', 'Hong Kong International Film Festival']", "sarc": "True", "ADDI_sex": "31.20555555555555", "userID": "USR1609782270", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "diagnosis_2": "", "ADI_age": "29.383333333333326", "jaccard_score": 4.203130281276981e-05}
