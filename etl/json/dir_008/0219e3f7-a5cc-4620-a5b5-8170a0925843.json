In other words, it will smash into an asteroid.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The mission will provide the first test of a technique that could be used in the future \u2013 to redirect any asteroids we detect on a collision course with Earth.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">A binary pair of space rocks</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">DART was launched on November 24, 2021, its destination a pair of asteroids in orbit around each other, 11 million kilometres from Earth.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The larger asteroid in the pair is called Didymos and is 780 metres in diameter. The smaller asteroid, just 160 metres wide, is called Dimorphos. The two orbit each other at a distance of 1.18 kilometres, and one orbit takes close to 12 hours.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">These asteroids pose no risk to Earth and have been chosen as the target for DART partly due to that fact. But also, importantly, because the asteroids form a binary pair, it will be possible for astronomers on Earth to assess the results of the impact.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">As the asteroids orbit each other, the sunlight reflected off them increases and decreases, varying systematically over the 12-hour cycle of the orbit. Astronomers using powerful telescopes from Earth can monitor this variation and see how it changes, from before to after the collision.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The physics is simple, the mission is not</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The physics sounds simple, and it is. Hit one thing with another thing to change its motion. But the mission execution is very complicated. When DART reaches the asteroids, it will be 11 million kilometres from Earth after a 10 month journey. The spacecraft has to use autonomous targeting, using images of the asteroids it acquires as it approaches.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">DART needs to recognise the asteroids by itself, automatically lock onto Dimorphos, and adjust its trajectory to hit it. </p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Read more: https://theconversation.com/in-a-world-first-nasas-dart-mission-is-about-to-smash-into-an-asteroid-what-will-we-learn-189391</p>", "Age": "21", "id": "0219e3f7-a5cc-4620-a5b5-8170a0925843", "diagnosis_1": "", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-166417340620469.jpeg", "Title": "In a world first, NASA\u2019s DART mission is about to smash into an asteroid.
