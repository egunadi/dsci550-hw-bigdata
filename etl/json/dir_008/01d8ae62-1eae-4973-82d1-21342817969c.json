{"ADDI_age": "41.39629629629629", "Narrative": "More evidence of culinary feuds between Australia and New Zealand, as well as dubious origin legends, may be found in the modest Lamington. The Lamington is made using sponge cake that has been cut into cubes and then topped with chocolate sauce and desiccated coconut. \n\nAccording to legend, a maid for Queensland Governor Lord Lamington slipped cake into chocolate sauce by accident. Lamington was born after the Governor requested that it be rolled in coconut to keep his fingers from becoming sticky. \n\nWasn't it? Other stories credit the inclusion of the tropical coconut to the Governor's cook, who was French-born but married a Tahitian woman. While its origins are still questioned, one thing is certain: Lamingtons are a must-try dessert in Australia.", "diagnosis_1": "", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-165516966599658.jpeg", "userPrimaryID": "33262", "DDI_age": "28.392592592592596", "Interest": "Food", "id": "01d8ae62-1eae-4973-82d1-21342817969c", "accountCreateDte": "2022-04-22", "most_likely_activity": "", "ADI_sex": "30.177777777777784", "Festivals": "['Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022', 'Atlanta Film Festival 2022', 'Milwaukee Film Festival 2022']", "GLAAD": "False", "sport_event": "['Invictus Games', 'World Snooker Championship']", "diagnosis_3": "", "ADI_age": "36.71666666666667", "ADDI_sex": "34.87222222222221", "least_likely_activity": "", "sarc": "False", "Title": "Lamingtons: New Zealand or Australia?", "userID": "USR1650593818", "storyPrimaryID": "107052", "Gender": "", "Age": "30", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "storyID": "STY1655169707", "ADL": "False", "diagnosis_2": "", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.6777389961173586e-05}
