He says we all stand for the fire as a dangerous one but a cold state/phase is also as deadly as the fierce one. The poem is very compact with smart diction and a rhyming scheme. The clipped precision of vocabulary is what makes the poem special. He symbolises desire and hates through fire and ice in the poem. So which is your favourite poem by Frost?
