Ward Prowse remains a constant threat from any dead ball situation, providing great delivery and the ability to go for goal himself.\n\nOn being asked who they would choose to score a penalty to save their lives, here's what Micah\nRichards and Thierry Henry said about Ward Prowse\u2019s ability.\n\nKate Abdo: \u201cYou have one penalty to save your life, which player in the history of football do\nyou ask to take it,\u201d\n\nMicah Richards: \u201cI would go with James Ward-Prowse. He is excellent.\u201d\n\nThierry Henry: \u201cSorry?\u201d\n\nMicah Richards: \u201cJames Ward-Prowse.\u201d\n\nThierry Henry: \u201cOh, okay. He can finish. James Ward-Prowse can finish.\u201d\n\nIt would be interesting to see how Antonio Conte would play the midfielder at Tottenham, with\nboth Hojbjerg and Bentancur in fine forms towards the end of the season. However, Ward Prowse would bring creative passing to the table, something that neither of these two players\npossess in abundance. It would be incredibly good signing for Tottenham.", "ADI_sex": "26.211111111111126", "most_likely_activity": "Health", "accountCreateDte": "2022-03-01", "diagnosis_3": "Botulism", "DDI_age": "28.392592592592596", "diagnosis_1": "Medication reaction", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-165407980447481.png", "storyID": "STY1654079955", "storyPrimaryID": "104012", "Title": "\u2018He Can Finish\u2019 Thierry Henry praises Tottenham transfer target", "median_activity": "Health", "GLAAD": "False", "Gender": "male", "userPrimaryID": "28653", "Interest": "thierry henry, tottenham, football, news", "ADI_age": "36.71666666666667", "DDI_sex": "22.607407407407408", "sport_event": "['Six Nations']", "id": "021ec8c3-1aa2-4611-9edb-7f2e59e7b7a7", "least_likely_activity": "Repair", "sarc": "True", "ADDI_sex": "31.20555555555555", "Age": "30", "ADL": "False", "Festivals": "", "jaccard_score": 4.728521566436604e-05}
