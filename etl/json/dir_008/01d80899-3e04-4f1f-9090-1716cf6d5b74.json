It may even prevent them from moving forward in life.\n\nEveryone carries unprocessed emotions from experiences to some degree. However, emotions that aren\u2019t dealt with don\u2019t just go away.\n\nThey can affect:\n\n1 the way you think about yourself\n2 how you react to stress\n3 your physical well-being\n4 your relationships with others\n\nAfter all, emotional baggage gets its name from somewhere, right?\n\nLet\u2019s unpack the layers of how and where emotions get stuck, so you can release what\u2019s weighing you down.\n\n\nWhat does it mean to have \u2018trapped\u2019 emotions?\n\nPerhaps you\u2019ve heard of people crying during yoga, massage, or acupuncture treatment because of a tender spot that, when activated, appears to lead to an emotional release.\n\nThough some may refer to trauma being \u201cstored\u201d or \u201ctrapped\u201d in the body, that isn\u2019t necessarily a scientific way to put it.\n\nHowever, the symptoms of traumatic stress can manifest physically.\n\nThis may be because the brain associates this area with a particular memory \u2014 often on a subconscious level.\n\nActivating certain areas of the body may trigger these memories, according to Mark Olson, PhD, LMT, the owner and director of the Pacific Center for Awareness & Bodywork.\n\n\u201cEmotions are constantly being generated \u2014 subconsciously or consciously \u2014 in response to the reactivation of memories or unsatisfied goals,\u201d Olson says. \u201cThe touch to X area is simply a reliable stimulus to reconstruct the pattern associated with that traumatic event.\u201d\n\n\nAlternatively, some believe that trauma and difficult emotions can, in fact, become literally stuck energy in the body, though this isn\u2019t supported by scientific evidence.\n\n\nRead more - https://www.healthline.com/health/mind-body/how-to-release-emotional-baggage-and-the-tension-that-goes-with-it", "diagnosis_3": "Depression", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "Festivals": "", "id": "01d80899-3e04-4f1f-9090-1716cf6d5b74", "least_likely_activity": "Housework", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
