Allergy symptoms often occur when people's immune system reacts to an allergic trigger. \nAllergies can be different and do not require a standard treatment always, but these can be some ways to treat the allergies.\n\n-Oral antihistamines reduce allergy reactions and congestion.\n-Nasal corticosteroid sprays can help with sinus and nasal congestion.\n-Antihistamine eyedrops reduce redness, itching and watering of the eyes.\n-Saline (salt water) nasal sprays and gels also can help by flushing pollen from the nose and sinuses and reducing congestion. This can help alleviate that yucky feeling of mucus at the back of your nose and throat. Mucous-relieving medications and cough products, such as expectorants, can ease some symptoms.", "GLAAD": "False", "diagnosis_3": "", "ADDI_sex": "34.87222222222221", "id": "0204e7fb-5d50-43d0-9bc8-e0560072fbf3", "least_likely_activity": "", "Interest": "allergies, Health", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "sarc": "False", "sport_event": "['World Snooker Championship']", "Gender": "", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "accountCreateDte": "2022-04-25", "ADL": "False", "diagnosis_2": "", "storyID": "STY1655154608", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.6777389961173586e-05}
