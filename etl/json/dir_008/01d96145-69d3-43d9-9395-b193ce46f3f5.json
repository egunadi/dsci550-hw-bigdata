Animals deserve the basic right to live in their natural environment, and to be treated fairly. It is perfectly fine for animals to be used as meat, however there is no reason why they shouldn\u2019t live a happy and natural life. Animals can feel pain. Animals can think. Therefore there\u2019s absolutely NO reason why animals need to be cruelly and unethically treated, as seen through the distressing ways they\u2019re treated when factory farmed.
