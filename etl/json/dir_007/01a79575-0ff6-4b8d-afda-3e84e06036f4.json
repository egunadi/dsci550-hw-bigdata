In the back bedroom of the unit, the group discovered a cache of stolen wiretapping equipment that turned out to have direct lines into six of New York City\u2019s largest telephone exchanges:\u00a0PLaza 1, 3, and 5; MUrray Hill 8; ELdorado 5; and TEmpleton 8. The connections blanketed an area of Manhattan running from East 38th Street to East 96th Street, a swath of the city\u2019s most expensive real\u00a0estate.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a single tap-free telephone on the east side of New York,\u201d professional wiretapper\u00a0Bernard Spindel\u00a0remarked of the arrangement. (Spindel was in all likelihood the source of the anonymous tip.) News of the discovery made the\u00a0front page of the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0a week later.\n\nThe midtown Manhattan \u201cwiretap nest,\u201d as the 55th Street listening post came to be known, remains one of the largest and most elaborate private eavesdropping operations ever uncovered in the United States. Subscribers whose phones were tapped at the time of the raid included a range of New York commercial interests, with assets both large and small: a modeling agency and an insurance company; an art gallery and a lead mining company; and perhaps most sensationally, two publicly traded pharmaceutical corporations with competing patent interests. (The two firms, Bristol-Myers and\u00a0E. R. Squibb, were at the time locked in a nasty legal battle over the commercial rights to the antibiotic tetracycline. Evidence later revealed that representatives from a third firm, Pfizer, had employed the wiretap nest to spy on both entities, paying more than $60,000 in cash for the service.)\n\nContrary to the popular image of the phone tap as either a technology of state surveillance or a tool of corporate espionage, the vast majority of the lines ensnared in the\u00a055th Street operation\u00a0turned out to be owned by private individuals.\n\nRead more\nhttps://spectrum.ieee.org/illegal-wiretapping", "userPrimaryID": "7230", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-16484196882383.png", "Interest": "new york city, usa", "most_likely_activity": "", "ADI_sex": "30.177777777777784", "ADI_age": "27.866137566137564", "Age": "13", "GLAAD": "False", "diagnosis_3": "", "ADDI_sex": "34.87222222222221", "least_likely_activity": "", "sarc": "False", "storyPrimaryID": "90342", "Gender": "others", "id": "01a79575-0ff6-4b8d-afda-3e84e06036f4", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "userID": "USR1624570088", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "diagnosis_2": "", "Title": "When New York City Was a Wiretapper\u2019s Dream", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.6777389961173586e-05}
