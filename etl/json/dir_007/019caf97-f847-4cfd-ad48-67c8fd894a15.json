But the tokenism keeps making its way back as a stubborn aftertaste in your mouth: the artist Dominique Holmes didn\u2019t even get an advance notice about the coin\u2019s launch.\n\nHolmes posted on social media about their reservation to work for the Royal Mint project, quoting the rampant pinkwashing that corporates love to flaunt during pride. But they also noted that this project could broaden the conversation about Pride and protest.\n\n\u201cWe all know that this coin won\u2019t force our shitshow government into finally banning conversion therapy, or roll back the levels of homelessness in our queer youth. Those are major issues we continue to fight. But I truly hope it will raise funds our community desperately needs to progress, whilst commemorating the progress made so far, and maybe bringing a little bit of queer joy,\u201d Holmes wrote on Instagram.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s not like the coin will get a chance to be stuffed hurriedly in millions of pockets from the change received by a barista or taxi driver. Get this: you have to PURCHASE the 50p Progress Pride Flag coin.\n\nMeanwhile, Boris Johnson has been promoting a divisive \u2018conversion\u2019 therapy ban that targets transgender people by excluding them from being protected.\n\nYouth who are subjected to the harmful practice of so-called \u2018conversion\u2019 therapy, which baselessly claims to \u2018change\u2019 a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity \u2013are twice as likely to be at risk of suicide compared to those who aren\u2019t, and transgender and nonbinary youth are twice as likely to be subjected to conversion therapy.\n\nA growing list of 14 countries including France, Canada, Brazil, Norway and Samoa, have bans on the harmful practice of \u2018conversion\u2019 therapy.", "Interest": "transgender rights, transgender, trans youth, transgender community, pride, pride month, pridemonth, lgbtq+, lgbtqia+, lgbt, lgbtq, lgbtqia, lgbtqi, lgbtq community, lgbt community, Inequality, Politics", "diagnosis_3": "Depression", "sport_event": "", "Title": "Two Cents On The 50p Pride Coin | The Stubborn Aftertaste Of Pinkwashed Tokenism", "jaccard_score": 4.728521566436604e-05}
