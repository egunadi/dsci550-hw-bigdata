As species lose out on their habitats and the resources they need to survive to deforestation, their populations slowly die out, sometimes to the point of extinction. In fact, deforestation drives an estimated 135 different species of plants, animals, and insects to extinction every day.\n\nAnimal agriculture is the biggest driver of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, which houses over 10% of the Earth\u2019s biodiversity. By leaving animals off of our plate and reducing demand for meat, we take away the meat industry\u2019s incentive to destroy forest habitats for their production\u2014not only saving farm animals, but protecting wild animals, too.", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-166051962862517.png", "sport_event": "['Wimbledon', \"Women's FIH Hockey World Cup\", 'Tour de France']", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "ADI_sex": "34.144444444444446", "sarc": "False", "diagnosis_2": "Viral infections", "userID": "USR1656900850", "storyPrimaryID": "126899", "storyID": "STY1660519671", "least_likely_activity": "Maintenance", "accountCreateDte": "2022-07-04", "ADL": "False", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
