Under the status quo, the terms of the expiring agreement will stay in effect. \n\nThe men from the United States have been playing under a contract that ended on December 31, 2018.\n\n\u201cOver the past two weeks, U.S. Soccer and representatives from the players\u2019 associations for our U.S. men\u2019s and women\u2019s senior national teams have been in all-day collective bargaining sessions,\u201d the U.S. Soccer Federation said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nLast month, the federation and the women's team players reached an agreement in which the players would divide $22 million and the federation would set up a fund with $2 million to help the players in their post-soccer careers and philanthropic initiatives focused at promoting the sport for women. The deal, which brings an end to a six-year legal struggle, is contingent on collective bargaining agreements with the unions that represent women and men separately.", "storyPrimaryID": "91182", "most_likely_activity": "", "Age": "12", "Title": "US Soccer, Women's Union\u2019s Next Move", "ADI_sex": "30.177777777777784", "id": "01d06c99-0171-4ba4-b5d6-267c9c15004e", "storyID": "STY1648743996", "ADI_age": "27.866137566137564", "GLAAD": "False", "Interest": "Sports", "diagnosis_3": "", "ADDI_sex": "34.87222222222221", "least_likely_activity": "", "sarc": "False", "Gender": "", "accountCreateDte": "2022-02-09", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "ADL": "False", "diagnosis_2": "", "Festivals": "", "median_activity": "", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-164874381934568.jpeg", "jaccard_score": 3.502608567730818e-05}
