His remarks were\u00a0reported by Rolling Stone.\n\nTruth Social, which was created as a right-wing alternative to Twitter after Trump was banned from the microblogging site for his part in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol, was launched in February.\n\nThe app\u00a0has been available solely on Apple devices.
