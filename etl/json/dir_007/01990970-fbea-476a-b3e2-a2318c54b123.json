The Portuguese striker has now received a bid with \u00a3211m in salary from a Saudi Pro League club. \n\nThe details of this \"unnamed\" club are currently not known. According to Metro Sport, \"Ronaldo has been presented with an enormous offer from Saudi Arabia that would make him the highest-paid player in history \u2013 but he would have to give up European football. The offer, likely funded by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, would see Ronaldo earn an eye-watering \u20ac250million (\u00a3211m) over two seasons.\" This equates to something around \u00a32m per week, this is 5-times more than his current salary at Manchester United. \n\nThere is still no confirmation from Ronaldo's camp regarding what the Portuguese striker decides to do. CR7 has not returned to train with the Manchester United squad owing to \"family reasons\". Rumours are strongly linking the striker to a move away from United with Chelsea, Bayern Munich, and PSG said to be his possible destination in the coming days. \n\nThe unnamed Saudi Arabian club is also looking to make a transfer bid of  \u00a325m to Manchester United for the striker's services. Also, as part of the transfer, Ronaldo\u2019s agent, Jorge Mendes, would receive around \u00a317m in what could be one of the biggest paydays \u2013 and most surprising transfers \u2013 in modern football history.", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "sarc": "False", "userID": "USR1643055418", "Gender": "", "id": "01990970-fbea-476a-b3e2-a2318c54b123", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "storyPrimaryID": "115946", "ADL": "False", "diagnosis_2": "", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.6777389961173586e-05}
