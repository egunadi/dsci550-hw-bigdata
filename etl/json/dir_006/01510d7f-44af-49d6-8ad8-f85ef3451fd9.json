The rocket travelled the four miles to the launch pad in just under ten hours, drawing up around dawn.\n\nThe lunar test flight's planned liftoff is scheduled for August 29 by NASA. Only three mannequins covered with sensors to assess radiation and vibration will be inside the crew capsule atop the rocket. \n\nThe spacecraft will spend a few weeks in an extended orbit around the moon before returning to Earth and splashing down in the Pacific. The full journey ought to take six weeks.", "most_likely_activity": "", "storyID": "STY1661044380", "Title": "An unmanned rocket to moon!", "ADI_sex": "30.177777777777784", "ADI_age": "27.866137566137564", "GLAAD": "False", "diagnosis_3": "", "ADDI_sex": "34.87222222222221", "least_likely_activity": "", "sport_event": "['Six Nations']", "sarc": "False", "Interest": "nasa", "accountCreateDte": "2022-03-02", "Festivals": "['Glasgow International Film Festival 2022', 'Santa Barbara International Film Festival 2022']", "userID": "USR1646194669", "Gender": "", "id": "01510d7f-44af-49d6-8ad8-f85ef3451fd9", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-166104426651846.jpeg", "ADL": "False", "Age": "17", "diagnosis_2": "", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.6777389961173586e-05}
