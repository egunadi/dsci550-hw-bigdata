Edge was laid out from ringside to the backstage area on a stretcher.\n\nAccording to a new report from Fightful Select, the reason for Edge leaving the group has to do with the direction that WWE wanted to take with it. In the report, Fightul was told that WWE had mentioned that they wanted to take Judgement Day into more of a \u201csupernatural route,\u201d which Edge was said to have been opposed to.\n\nEdge didn't want to affiliated with the stable anymore and hence the idea of his exit emerged in the afternoon hours ahead of \u201cRaw.\u201d The pitch of Balor becoming a member and turning heel was days before \u201cHell in the Cell,\u201d and there was no mention at that point of Edge leaving the stable.\n\nThe angle was surprising to say the least, but the idea of the trip fairing well without the Rated R Superstar is unfathomable to me. While the three of them are great talents, they all lack the X Factor that Edge brought to the table.", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
