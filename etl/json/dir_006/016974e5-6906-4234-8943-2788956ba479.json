However, the primary value in mar-tech starts in the post-acquisition phase, said Sidharth Rao, Co-Founder of Punt and former Group CEO, DentsuMB Group, in an interview with BestMediaInfo.com. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;Even globally, this space is largely dominated by tech platforms and the likes of Accenture/Deloitte. Let&#8217;s just say that legacy agencies will have a steep learning curve or will have to adopt inorganic strategies to widen their skill set,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Earlier in May 2022, Rao took everyone in the industry by surprise by quitting Dentsu. His agency Webchutney, which he founded along with Sudesh Samaria in 1999, was acquired by Dentsu in 2013 after buying out Network18's stake in the agency. Come September 2022, he along with Madhu Sudhan, a serial entrepreneur himself, announced the launch of mar-tech firm, Punt.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Punt, looking at closing a seed round of investment very soon, aims to build specialist skills to ensure brands can identify and implement the right mar-tech products and drive outcomes with optimal utilisation of the mar-tech stack they have chosen. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sudhan explained, &#8220;Marketers are dealing with an increasingly complex set of products in their sales and marketing stacks to drive acquisition and retention. Quite often, marketers do not build the skills in-house to leverage these products to their fullest extent or to ensure they work well with all the other products they are using. This leads to a dual problem - poor outcomes for the marketer and churns for the product provider.&#8221;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Punt&#8217;s ambitions include servicing the North American/UK/ Middle East markets with delivery from India.<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Read more: https://bestmediainfo.com/2022/09/legacy-agencies-will-either-have-steep-learning-curve-or-adopt-inorganic-strategies-sidharth-rao-and-madhu-sudhan</p>", "jaccard_score": 3.8528694245038994e-05}
