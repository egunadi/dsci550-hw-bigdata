She was left bleeding from the brain and with a fractured skull in what they described as a brutal and unprovoked attack.\n\nAn NYPD spokesperson told CNN Sunday William Blount, 57, had been arrested over the attack after police conducted extensive video canvassing across the city.\n\nBlount was arrested at his registered place of residence, which police described as a \"shelter.\"\n\nThe NYPD spokesperson said police are recommending charges of attempted murder, robbery and assault for Blount.\n\nBlount has not yet been arraigned, Kim Livingston, a spokeswoman for the Queens District Attorney's Office, said, adding a complaint for his case has yet to be written. As such, Blount does not yet retain legal representation, Livingston said. Blount is scheduled to appear in court Monday, at which time his counsel will then be identified, according to Livingston.\n\nNYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said at a news conference Friday afternoon the suspect had kicked the woman and struck her \"numerous times\" before fleeing on foot with her purse.\n\nThe woman's family identified her as Nina Rothschild, a scientist for the New York City Department of Health. She was attacked just 15 minutes after leaving work, police said.\n\n\"This is an unprovoked, brutal and appalling crime on a woman who was just trying to get home after a day's work,\" Essig said.\n\nRothschild, who was bleeding from her brain, was taken to Cornell Medical Center with a fractured skull and lacerations to her face, Essig said.\n\nShe has had part of her skull replaced with wire mesh, according to her brother, Gerson Rothschild. She also has a drop foot, a condition where the patient is unable to lift their foot.", "Gender": "others", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "id": "0174b7e2-1a1b-4284-8d47-4dd4b380de3b", "userID": "USR1624570088", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "diagnosis_2": "", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.8528694245038994e-05}
