A rather remarkable feat for a geopolitical union that is alarmingly obsolete and scandalously audacious.\u00a0\n\nAfter letting go of her marquee colonies, via rebellion and abdication, Queen Elizabeth, still reigning, shared her momentous vision for the new Commonwealth in 1953. It was meant to usher in a splendid ethos of friendship, projecting the foremost values of integrity and collaboration. Even by the highest standards of benevolent thuggery, which the empire ably epitomised, this noble befriending of the shamelessly looted was priceless chutzpah.\n\nIn truth, this was an extension of their well-honed exit template, not so smartly replicated in Brexit.
