What a game. We probably should have killed it off in the first half; we really could have been three or four ahead by the break. Second half was not so good, but we reacted well to the Villa goal and got the three points. Here\u2019s my player ratings from the game\u2026\n\nRamsdale - 7 - Didn\u2019t do much wrong.\n\nTierney - 7 - Technically inferior to Zinchenko but defended well.\n\nGabriel - 9 - What a performance.\n\nSaliba - 7 - A bit shaky in the second half\n\nWhite - 8 - Another solid display\n\nLokonga - 9 - Proved a lot of people wrong\n\nXhaka - 9 - My MOTM. So, so good\n\n\u00d8degaard - 7 - Not at his best but good nonetheless\n\nMartinelli - 8.5 - Always dangerous, lovely goal.\n\nJesus - 9 - So strong, so powerful. What a player we have!\n\nSaka - 8 -  Much better performance but should have scored. Great assist for the winning goal.\n\nSubs:\n\nTomiyasu - Very good when he came on. \n\nNothing much to say about Holding or Smith Rowe, but Nketiah was superb again off the bench.\n\n15/15. Great start to the season.", "ADL": "False", "Age": "17", "diagnosis_2": "", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.8528694245038994e-05}
