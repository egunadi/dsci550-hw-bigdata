She stopped to get something from the store. When she came out she was in the walkway and the car came up on the sidewalk and crushed her,\u201d said the friend, who only gave his first name, Ibrahim.\n\nThe 35-year-old woman at the wheel had just finished shopping, and was trying to make a left turn, edging too far into the street as she waited for traffic to ease, said supermarket worker Legend Jones, 43.\n\n\u201cShe went across there from zero to 60. She gunned it and went straight into the building,\u201d he said. \u201cShe meant to take the left, but she went straight.\u201d\n\nHer SUV barreled across the street and mounted the curb, striking the girl and a woman, 33, before smashing through the long-closed car wash and hitting a support pillar, sources said. Two other pedestrians, a man and a young boy, scrambled out of the way in time, sources said.", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-164452119142680.png", "most_likely_activity": "", "storyPrimaryID": "80550", "storyID": "STY1644521255", "ADI_sex": "30.177777777777784", "ADI_age": "27.866137566137564", "Age": "13", "GLAAD": "False", "diagnosis_3": "", "ADDI_sex": "34.87222222222221", "least_likely_activity": "", "Interest": "new york city, news", "sarc": "False", "Gender": "others", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "userID": "USR1624570088", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "diagnosis_2": "", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.6777389961173586e-05}
