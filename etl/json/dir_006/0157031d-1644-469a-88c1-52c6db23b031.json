Her life story helped people relate to her even now or then.\nBesides her bold and stylish appearance, what people liked the most was her caring and compassionate nature. \n\nDespite her failed marriage, she continued to work as an epitome of a perfect woman.\nHer vulnerability, disappointment and the way to come out of the morass are all captured and kept carefully in the eyes of the public.\nAs the world calls it, she was people's princess. In 1987 she was famously seen shaking an Aids patient\u2019s hand without wearing gloves, sending a message to the terrifying world that the disease could not be transmitted by touch.\nHer exuberance and aura are taken forward by her sons, William and Harry.\n\nDiana broke stereotypes and spoke her mind even at times when breaking a royal protocol would be a sin. She was also among the first royals \"to speak about her mental health struggles, which she did in her now-infamous 1995 BBC Panorama interview with Martin Bashir, where she admitted to suffering from depression and bulimia.\" \nShe did much as a woman, mother, wife and more than everything as a human being.\nHistory knows many women who made themselves role models; Diana will remain one of them.", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "sarc": "False", "sport_event": "['World Snooker Championship']", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-166102501057234.png", "userPrimaryID": "33780", "Gender": "", "Age": "22", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "accountCreateDte": "2022-04-25", "ADL": "False", "diagnosis_2": "", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.6777389961173586e-05}
