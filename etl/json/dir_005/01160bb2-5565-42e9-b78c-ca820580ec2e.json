He made 2.91 passes, and 7.07 in making the run with the ball. It puts him into the 90 percentile. <br>\nGavi has been called a reliable midfielder as he doesn&#8217;t jeopardize the build-up play, the possession, or near the danger area, which could lead to a possible counterattack by the opposition.<br>\nGavi possesses the technique to position himself in spaces. He scans the pitch to position himself to receive passes in good situations.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From the heatmap, we can see that Gavi made most of his touches in the penalty area and in the attacking third area of the pitch with 3.81 and 26.54 touches per 90, putting them at 99 and 95 percentile respectively. His touch heatmap shows that he made touches mostly in the left side of the pitch.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Verdict</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Gavi got his debut under Ronald Koeman when he was just a mere 17 years old. Since then, he gone from strength to strength, showing maturity beyond his years. As always a footballer has room for growth and improvement in their game and you can expect Gavi to finesse his game to be one of the best midfielders in the world. <br>\n</p>", "ADI_age": "36.71666666666667", "DDI_sex": "22.607407407407408", "Age": "31", "storyID": "STY1665500121", "sarc": "False", "id": "01160bb2-5565-42e9-b78c-ca820580ec2e", "ADDI_sex": "31.20555555555555", "ADL": "False", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
