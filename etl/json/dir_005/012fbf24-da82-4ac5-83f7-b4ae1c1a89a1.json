It is the most iconic cuisine which is still being discovered and appreciated by the world!\n\nNomadsworld talks about how the most popular one that 'foreigners' discover and, more often than not, despise is Vegemite! No matter how many people tell you it\u2019s disgusting you should try it at least once. \n\nSo, what exactly is Vegemite? Vegemite is a dark brown paste created from a combination of vegetables, yeast extract, and spices. It's similar to the famous love it or hate it ads for marmite in the UK, which admitted that it's not to everyone's taste. The most popular method to consume it is with butter on bread or toast.
