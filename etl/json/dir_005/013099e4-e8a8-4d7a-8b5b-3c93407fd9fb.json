Apart from losing two consecutive premiere league matches Ten hag should change the tactical implements and should have a more flexible formations in the wishlist. \n\nUsing the right players in the starting eleven and making right changes at right time according to the match situations is needed. \n\nWhat do you think ? Erik ten hag can drag manchester united to the top of the league ? \n\nThankyou \u26bd", "accountCreateDte": "2022-03-29", "least_likely_activity": "Writing", "Title": "ERIK TEN HAG to be on the edge of getting sacked ?", "median_activity": "Health", "GLAAD": "False", "Gender": "male", "DDI_sex": "22.607407407407408", "userPrimaryID": "29720", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "storyPrimaryID": "126725", "sarc": "True", "ADDI_sex": "31.20555555555555", "diagnosis_3": "Depression", "ADL": "False", "jaccard_score": 4.728521566436604e-05}
