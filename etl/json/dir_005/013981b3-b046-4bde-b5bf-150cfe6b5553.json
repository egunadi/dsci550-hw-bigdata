All of them orbited our Sun. However, a recent flurry of discoveries represents a pivotal point in science. NASA has confirmed more than 5,000 exoplanets beyond our solar system in a cosmic milestone. A planet outside the Solar System is known as an exoplanet or extrasolar planet.\n\nThe number of confirmed exoplanets has recently topped 5,000, bringing a 30-year odyssey to a close. NASA celebrated a major milestone by announcing that its space telescopes had assisted in the confirmation of thousands of new exoplanets", "ADL": "False", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
