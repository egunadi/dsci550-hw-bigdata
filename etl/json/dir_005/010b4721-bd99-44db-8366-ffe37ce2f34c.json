As a new adipokine, asprosin participates in the development of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, and is considered to be closely related to insulin resistance and glucolipid metabolism. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between serum asprosin level and carotid plaque in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\n\nMethods\n\nA total of 180 patients with T2DM were selected. The basic parameters and biochemical indexes of the subjects were measured, and the serum asprosin concentration of the subjects was detected by ELISA. The carotid plaque was evaluated by color Doppler ultrasound.\n\nResults\n\nThe level of serum asprosin in the T2DM with carotid plaque group was significantly higher than that in T2DM without carotid plaque group [2.53(1.73-3.21) vs. 1.72(1.23-2.34) ng/mL, P<0.05]. The incidence of carotid plaque in the low, middle and high quartiles was 31.7%, 48.3% and 70% respectively. Correlation analysis showed that serum asprosin was positively correlated with BMI, WHR, SBP, DBP, FIns, LDL-C, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-\u03b2 (P<0.05). Linear regression analysis showed that WHR, DBP, FIns, and LDL-C were independent influencing factors of asprosin. Logistic regression analysis showed that serum asprosin was still significantly correlated with carotid plaque in T2DM patients after adjusting for multiple confounding factors. The area under receiver-operating curve (ROC) of asprosin predicting carotid plaque was 0.701 (0.625-0.777) in T2DM.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe level of serum asprosin in T2DM patients with carotid plaques is significantly higher, suggesting that asprosin may play a role in the occurrence and development of carotid plaques in T2DM. Detection of this index can provide new clinical evidence for the prevention and treatment of diabetic cardiovascular disease.\n\nSources - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0009912022001928", "Interest": "diabetes", "most_likely_activity": "", "storyID": "STY1660043622", "userPrimaryID": "10695", "Age": "25", "ADI_sex": "30.177777777777784", "Title": "Association between circulating Asprosin levels and\u00a0carotid atherosclerotic plaque\u00a0in type 2", "GLAAD": "False", "diagnosis_3": "", "ADDI_sex": "34.87222222222221", "least_likely_activity": "", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "sarc": "False", "id": "010b4721-bd99-44db-8366-ffe37ce2f34c", "Festivals": "['Climate Crisis Film Festival', 'Aesthetica Short Film Festival', 'Denver Film Festival', 'Les Gai Cine Mad', 'UK Green Film Festival', 'Leeds International Film Festival', 'Sydney Film Festival', 'FILMZ - Festival des deutschen Kinos', 'Belfast Film Festival', 'Ankara Film Festival', 'Hawaii International Film Festival', 'Belo Horizonte International Short Film Festival', 'Arlington International Film Festival', 'Ojai International Film Festival', 'London Korean Film Festival', 'Mezipatra Queer Film Festival', 'Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival', 'Buffalo Dreams Fantastic Film Festival', 'Geneva International Film Festival', 'Arras Film Festival', 'MedFilm Festival', 'Thessaloniki International Film Festival', 'New Orleans Film Festival', 'Cork International Film Festival', 'Hamilton Film Festival', 'Cinanima - International Animated Film Festival', 'Mountain International Film Festival Graz', 'Brest European Short Film Festival', 'Internationale Kurzfilmtage Winterthur', 'La Cabina Festival - Festival Internacional de Mediometrajes de Val\u00e8ncia', 'Verzio International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival', 'AFI Fest', 'Escales documentaires - La Rochelle International Documentary Festival', 'Napa Valley Film Festival', 'Cucalorus Film Festival', 'DOC NYC', 'M\u00e1laga Fantastic Film Festival', 'Loft Film Fest', 'Stockholm International Film Festival', 'RIDM - Montreal International Documentary Festival', 'Canberra Short Film Festival', 'Rome International Film Festival', 'Films from the South Festival - Film Fra S\u00f8r', 'Alexandria Film Festival']", "sport_event": "['ICC World T20 (men)']", "Gender": "others", "userID": "USR1636632146", "accountCreateDte": "2021-11-11", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "ADL": "False", "diagnosis_2": "", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.8528694245038994e-05}
