The serene mosque is renowned for its distinctive architecture, with the 378 wooden Deodar pillars serving as the centrepiece. On Fridays, the mosque is very packed. Ablution or wadu is performed at the fountain located inside the mosque's grounds.\nSultan Sikandar Shah Kashmiri Shahmiri commissioned the construction of the Jamia Masjid in 1394. Mir Mohammad Hamadani, the son of Said-ul-Auliya Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani, gave the order. Zain-ul-Abidin, the son of Sultan Sikandar, later added a turret to the main building to extend the Jama Masjid.
