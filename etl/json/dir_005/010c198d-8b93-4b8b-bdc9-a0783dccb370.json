(photo credit AFP)\n\nThe body of Argentine-born guerrilla leader Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara is\u00a0displayed in the village of Vallegrande, Bolivia, on Oct. 10, 1967. \n\nGuevara was executed a day after being captured\u00a0near the town of\u00a0La Higuera. Marc Hutten of AFP had taken this pic. \n\nHe was a fighter who never gave up even when faced with a certain death. \n\n\n\"Do not shoot! I am Che Guevara and worth more to you alive than dead,\u201d he\u00a0said\u00a0as U.S.-trained Bolivian forces closed in. The Argentine-born\u00a0doctor and Marxist rebel leader who helped Fidel Castro seize power in Cuba was finally captured after 2 1/2 years of living in secrecy.\nA Washington Post article in 2017 perhaps aptly summed up his last moments. \n\n\u00a0\"Guevara was secretly buried in a mass grave, Bolivian soldiers laid out his scrawny body and put it on display for the media in the Bolivian village of Vallegrande. His corpse was placed on a hospital laundry sink as photographers took pictures that were later published internationally. The Bolivian commander also ordered both of Guevara\u2019s hands cut off so authorities could run his fingerprints and give Castro undeniable proof that his ally was dead.\"", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
