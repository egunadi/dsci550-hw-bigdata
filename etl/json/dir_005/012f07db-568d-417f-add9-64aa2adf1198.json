You'll gradually start to see Kashmir as you've never seen it before when you leave the valley's heavily travelled areas. \nAlong with its natural beauty, Watlab in Kashmir is well-known for its Muslim shrine perched atop a hill. In honour of the Muslim mystic Baba Shukurddin, a shrine was built. \n\nWhen standing in this spot, you can see Wular Lake for miles in every direction. The picturesque settlements that along the lake's perimeter enhance its natural beauty. The nearby paddy fields lend some colour to the background as well. In Watlab, there is a Forest Rest House hidden among lovely accommodations.", "DDI_sex": "22.607407407407408", "userPrimaryID": "58507", "sport_event": "[\"Women's FIH Hockey World Cup\", 'Tour de France', 'The Open Championship']", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "sarc": "False", "accountCreateDte": "2022-07-16", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-166037501790861.jpeg", "ADDI_sex": "31.20555555555555", "diagnosis_3": "Depression", "ADL": "False", "storyPrimaryID": "125479", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
