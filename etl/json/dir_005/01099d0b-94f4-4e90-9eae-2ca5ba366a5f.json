Talk to other people about how you are feeling. Irrational beliefs tend to fester when they are hidden and not talked about.<br>\nSo try talking to others and let it all out.<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Understanding that your abilities are not wasted is essential. \"If you have long-held beliefs about your incompetence in social and performance situations, make a realistic assessment of your abilities. Write down your accomplishments and what you are good at, then compare these with your self-assessment.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Besides all this, we should believe in taking small steps, which really works.<br>\nWe should not focus on doing things perfectly; the focus should be rational and reasonable instead of delusional.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> <br>\nYou know why self-talk is necessary? Because it lets you question yourself and develop a deep understanding between you and your mind.<br>\nThe question is whether your thoughts are rational. Does it make sense to believe that you are a fraud, given everything that you know?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another thing to do is stop comparing yourself with others. If you'll always compare your situation with others, it would fuel the feeling of incompetency, eventually worsening the syndrome.<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most importantly, don't let your constant nagging and thoughts stop you from achieving your goals. Do not let your beliefs hold you back.</p>", "ADDI_age": "49.88518518518518", "most_likely_activity": "", "userID": "USR1650905308", "ADI_sex": "30.177777777777784", "Festivals": "['Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022', 'Atlanta Film Festival 2022', 'Milwaukee Film Festival 2022']", "GLAAD": "False", "diagnosis_3": "", "ADDI_sex": "34.87222222222221", "least_likely_activity": "", "storyPrimaryID": "132430", "id": "01099d0b-94f4-4e90-9eae-2ca5ba366a5f", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "sarc": "True", "sport_event": "['World Snooker Championship']", "Gender": "", "Age": "22", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "accountCreateDte": "2022-04-25", "Title": "Do not let your thoughts hold you back", "ADL": "False", "Interest": "Health, impostor syndrome", "diagnosis_2": "", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.8528694245038994e-05}
