Horrifying images are aplenty in each one of them. \n\nThis picture of children fleeing a deadly napalm attack has become a defining image of the Vietnam War.\nBy all meabs, it has also become one of the most defining images of the 20th century. \n\nIt's a picture of uttar helplessness. Dark smoke billowing behind them, the young kids are trapped in a space and time of doom. \n\nSoldiers from the South Vietnamese army's 25th Division follow helplessly behind.\n\nTaken outside the village of Trang Bang on June 8, 1972, the picture captured the trauma and indiscriminate violence of a conflict that claimed, by some\u00a0estimates, a million or more civilian lives, as CNN has rightly described the moment. \n\nThough officially titled \"The Terror of War,\" the photo is better known by the nickname given to the badly burned, naked 9-year-old at its center: \"Napalm Girl\".\n\nThe girl, since identified as Phan Thi Kim Phuc, ultimately survived her injuries. This was thanks, in part, to Associated Press photographer Nick Ut, who assisted the children after taking his now-iconic image. Fifty years on from that fateful day, the pair are still in regular contact -- and using their story to spread a message of peace.", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
