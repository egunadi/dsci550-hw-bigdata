Now as Ukrainian civilians come under severe attack and refugees are pouring into other central European countries, the clamour for a military response from Nato is getting louder.\n\nThe Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has declared that the skies \u201cneeded to be closed over\u201d \u2013 and a Ukrainian journalist confronted the UK prime minister Boris Johnson at a press conference issuing a tearful demand for western support to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine \u2013 something Johnson rejected out of hand.\n\nThe obvious reason why the Ukrainians are desperate for a no-fly zone to be imposed is that it would limit Russia\u2019s options to launch airstrikes on Ukraine\u2019s cities. This despite the fact that \u2013 as Johnson pointed out \u2013 a no-fly zone would not prevent Russia from using missiles to hit targets in Ukraine. Britain\u2019s defence secretary Ben Wallace also argued against a no-fly zone, on the grounds that this would prevent Ukrainian warplanes from targeting Russian forces on the ground.\n\nThe tactical arguments against a no-fly zone are not convincing. A no-fly zone does not mean that no aircraft are permitted to fly, because it is enforced by aircraft that constantly patrol the skies. A no-fly zone could apply to hostile planes only if Ukrainian planes are equipped with Nato \u201cfriend-or-foe identification\u201d and would stop Russian attack helicopters supporting ground forces.\n\nIt would free the Ukrainian air force to target Russian convoys approaching major cities. The most fundamental reason why the US and the other Nato states are drawing a firm line against any direct combat missions in Ukraine has to do with the perceived risks of escalation.\n\nIndeed, Vladimir Putin has already issued a direct threat of the use of nuclear forces in response to economic measures and political attacks against Russia. So far, western leaders have ignored these threats because they do not consider them to be credible.\n\nFull story at The Conversation: https://theconversation.com/ukraine-war-why-nato-is-refusing-to-enforce-a-no-fly-zone-178338\nImage courtesy: EPA-EFE/Maxim Shipenkov", "Age": "39", "storyPrimaryID": "85289", "userID": "USR1614921720", "sarc": "False", "ADI_sex": "34.144444444444446", "sport_event": "['Six Nations', ' Nordic World Ski Championships']", "median_activity": "Food", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-164645935211233.jpeg", "id": "009eba2d-c4e6-48af-8f3c-1da4149b5a0e", "ADL": "False", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
