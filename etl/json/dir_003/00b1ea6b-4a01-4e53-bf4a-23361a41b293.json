With Nemanja Matic not being able to perform the role week in and week out due to his aging legs, those two were \u00a0 preferred by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and\u00a0 interim manager Ralf Rangnick.\u00a0 But the issue is they are not the defensive midfielders that the team needs.\u00a0 Even though the duo have performed well underRangnick,they also have been injured which forced Ralf to usually deploy the injury-prone Paul Pogba or the aging Matic. The incoming boss Erik Ten Hag has told Manchester United that he wants his former player Frenkie de Jong, who plays for Barcelona to play for the Red Devils. Let\u2019s dive into the Dutchman and what he will bring to the Man United side.\u00a0\n\n\n\nEarly Beginnings\n\n\nFrenkie De Jong started his professional journey at Willem II in 2015.

It takes his pass accuracy to 91.5%.\u00a0\n\nFrenkie has 37 key passes to his name this season.
