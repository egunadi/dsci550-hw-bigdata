After that Modi experienced paragliding a couple of times and even after becoming Gujarat\u2019s chief minister, his thrust with the adventure sport continued. He even invited Roshan to explore the paragliding sites in Gujarat. \u00a0\n\n\u201cGovind Singh Thakur, who is now an MLA from Manali and currently an education minister in Himachal, brought Modi Ji along with other visiting BJP dignitaries to Solang valley. All of them experienced paragliding. After that he (referring to Modi) got so fascinated with paragliding that it brought him to Manali on a number of occasions,\u201d recalls Roshan. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cIn August 1997, Modi Ji along with his friend, who was an industrialist,\u00a0visited my house in the village Burua. In fact, I received them at Bhuntar airport in Kullu and we all traveled to my village in my old 800 Maruti car,\u201d remembers Roshan, who is also an international skier. \u201cOn Modi Ji's insistence, as his friend was interested in starting paragliding in South\u00a0India,\u00a0I visited Ooty to explore the paragliding site. But unfortunately, we couldn't find the suitable spots for bigger flights, so the project couldn't take off at that time.\u201d\n\nTo be continued\u2026", "least_likely_activity": "Performing", "Interest": "narendra modi, roshan lal - the flying man, paragliding, manali, kullu, ooty, gujarat", "id": "00a2f778-a044-4c33-872b-44186ec30684", "Festivals": "['Barcelona International Short and Animation Film Festival', 'Santa Barbara International Film Festival', 'Hong Kong International Film Festival', 'Ulju Mountain Film Festival', 'Cr\u00e9teil International Women\u2019s Film Festival', 'IRC\u2019s Refugee Film Festival (Northern California)', 'Wasatch Mountain Film Festival', 'GLAS Animation Film Festival', 'Malm\u00f6 Arab Film Festival', 'Aspen Shorts Fest', 'Cleveland International Film Festival', 'Festival National du Film d\u2019Animation - Rennes M\u00e9tropole', 'Imagine Film Festival', 'Seattle International Film Festival', 'Annapolis Film Festival', 'Pink Screens - Brussels Queer Film Festival', 'Greenzland-Filmtage International Film Festival', 'Go Short Film Festival']", "diagnosis_3": "Carbon monoxide poisoning", "ADI_age": "33.07222222222222", "diagnosis_1": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder", "median_activity": "Health", "GLAAD": "False", "Gender": "male", "accountCreateDte": "2021-04-08", "DDI_sex": "22.607407407407408", "ADDI_age": "37.23703703703705", "diagnosis_2": "Hemochromatosis", "sarc": "True", "ADDI_sex": "31.20555555555555", "ADL": "False", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-164551402053653.png", "jaccard_score": 4.728521566436604e-05}
