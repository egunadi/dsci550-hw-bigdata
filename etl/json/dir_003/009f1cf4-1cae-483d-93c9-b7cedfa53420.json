Despite his co-stars\u2019 strong performances and author backed roles, he manages to hold his ground throughout the film. Vaani Kapoor shines in every scene that she appears in, while Sanjay Dutt aces as antagonist Daroga Shuddh Singh. The dichotomy in his name vis-a-vis his actions is an interesting addition to the character, and so is his sense of humour that adds to the overall theatrics of the role. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nHis actions often make you wonder if there is more to his power hungry character, and maybe a spin off on Daroga Shuddh Singh in the future would be a good idea to explore that aspect of the part. Other supporting cast including, Saurabh Shukla and Ronit Roy play their parts to the T. However, Ronit\u2019s character could have been experimented with a little more, as it gets completely stagnant after a point in the film. \n\nOverall, Karan Malhotra\u2019s Shamshera starring Ranbir Kapoor, Vaani Kapoor and Sanjay Dutt is in line with the ongoing trend of workable films, and has the right amount of drama, action, romance, humour and all other masala potboiler elements to entertain the audience. \ud83e\udee1\ud83e\udee1", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "diagnosis_2": "", "storyID": "STY1658490944", "Title": "Ranbir Kapoor, Vaani Kapoor & Sanjay Dutt\u2019s film has all the elements of a masala potboiler\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.6777389961173586e-05}
