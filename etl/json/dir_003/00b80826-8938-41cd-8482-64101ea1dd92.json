It's the sixth-highest grossing movie in domestic box office history. 2018's every-hero-but-the-kitchen-sink adventure \"Infinity War\" had a little help in building up anticipation. \"Maverick\" had Tom Cruise, a box office hero in his own right, but moviegoers hadn't felt the need for speed in 30 years.\n\nYet, thanks to stellar word-of-mouth and repeat customers, \"Maverick\" continues to defy the odds.  That's without playing in China or Russia, two major overseas markets. Can the \"Top Gun\" follow-up take down 2018's blockbuster \"Black Panther\" and its $700.4 million tally to crack the top five domestic grossers of all-time? It'll be fairly desolate at the box office until November, when \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" opens in theaters. \n\n\"Top Gun: Maverick\" is Cruise's first movie to reach $100 million in a single weekend. Joseph Kosinski directed the film, which picks up decades after the original Top Gun film. Miles Teller, Glen Powell, Jon Hamm, Jennifer Connelly and Val Kilmer all star.", "Age": "22", "storyPrimaryID": "129796", "ADL": "False", "userID": "USR1637905680", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
