It is located 45 kilometres from Poonch town in Surankote Tehsil, close to Behram Galla. As the stream falls, thick clouds of water vapour form, covering the environment and spreading everywhere. It was given the name Noori Chammb by Emperor Jahangir in honour of his adored queen Noor Jahan since he had grown so fond of and fancy of this fall. The Mughal queen liked to come here to relax. After taking a bath, she used to do her makeup in front of the mirror that had been attached to the mountain wall next to the fall.\nImage source: https://www.kashmirhills.com/waterfalls/noori-chamb/", "Festivals": "['Melbourne Documentary Film Festival 2022']", "most_likely_activity": "", "userID": "USR1657973041", "Title": "Noori Chammb", "Interest": "kashmir, kashmir valley, waterfall, waterfalls, nature, historical, historic", "ADI_sex": "30.177777777777784", "GLAAD": "False", "diagnosis_3": "", "userPrimaryID": "58524", "ADDI_sex": "34.87222222222221", "least_likely_activity": "", "sport_event": "[\"Women's FIH Hockey World Cup\", 'Tour de France', 'The Open Championship']", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "sarc": "False", "accountCreateDte": "2022-07-16", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-166079814155362.jpeg", "Gender": "", "storyPrimaryID": "128637", "storyID": "STY1660798290", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "ADL": "False", "diagnosis_2": "", "median_activity": "", "id": "00b4dc34-41eb-419c-a377-8fff79fc060a", "jaccard_score": 3.6777389961173586e-05}
