And here they are, in the public gallery, watching their daughter speak in our federal parliament.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy family is of Chinese heritage, but my parents were born and raised in Laos. They fled their homeland and were incredibly lucky Australia gave them refuge.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen my parents came here, they had limited formal education and spoke very little English.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey worked hard in factories, where they were able to find secure work with good conditions. They gave my brother and me the work and education opportunities they never had, and my family was able to thrive here. I went on to have the most incredible career, working in international development in the Asia-Pacific and then in international education.\u201d\n\nShe continued her heart-felt speech by acknowledging the power of \u201cthe Australian story.\u201d", "Interest": "Politics", "diagnosis_2": "", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.6777389961173586e-05}
