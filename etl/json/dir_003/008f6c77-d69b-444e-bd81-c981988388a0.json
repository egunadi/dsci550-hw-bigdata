While skincare products help your skin, you can absolutely not solely depend on them alone. A proper diet is important and so is proper sleep.\n\nLack of sleep reduces natural glow and beauty: The body's fluid balance is restored when we sleep. Skin can regain moisture, and the body processes extra water for elimination in general.\n\nLack of sleep hastens the ageing process because while we sleep, our skin produces new collagen. Collagen keeps the skin supple, which delays the appearance of wrinkles and lessens the effects of ageing.\n\nDark circles form around the eyes when people don't get enough sleep, which also causes swollen eyes.\n\nHaving a good sleep cycle goes a long way with your health. Not just your skin but your body and mental health over all depends greatly on sleep. Remember to keep a healthy sleep schedule and see the difference!", "jaccard_score": 3.8528694245038994e-05}
