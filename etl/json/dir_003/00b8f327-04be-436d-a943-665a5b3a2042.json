But in the limited overs format he couldn\u2019t win any ICC title for the country.\n\nIf we talk of ICC limited overs tournaments, Mahendra Singh Dohni led India to grab the T20 World Cup title in 2007 and 50-over format\u2019s world cup in 2011. Under his leadership, India was number one in test team rankings in 2009. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe first Indian skipper to win a World Cup was Kapil Dev \u2013 in 1983.\n\nBatting maestros Sunil Gawaskar and Sachin Tendulkar were remembered more for their individual proficiency rather than the role of captainship. Sourav Ganguly\u2019s aggressive approach made him standout among the Indian skippers of the current era.\n\nBut if I have to rate someone as the greatest Indian captain of all times, then it\u2019s Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi. He taught Indians the meaning of victory on a foreign soil and his proficiency on batting and fielding at the top-level despite losing an eye in a road accident made him an extraordinary player among the stars. \u00a0\n\nIn July 1961, in a road accident he permanently lost his right eye and five months after the tragedy, he made his test debut against visiting side England and went on to score a century in his third test.\n\nAt the time when fielding didn\u2019t get a prominence, his long covering reach made fielding a spectacular show and earned him a nickname \u2018Tiger\u2019. He was rated as the world\u2019s best fielder of that era. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn March 1962, at 21, he became the test captain \u2013 then the youngest in the world. Under his leadership, India registered its first win overseas against New Zealand and subsequently won the first series on a foreign land.\n\nTiger Pataudi played 46 tests for India, out of which 40 as a captain \u2013 winning 9, drawing 12 and losing 19. Despite of a poor win record, he was one who infused an aggressive approach into Indian cricket and taught us to fly the tricolor on foreign shores.", "storyID": "STY1644736201", "diagnosis_3": "Carbon monoxide poisoning", "ADI_age": "33.07222222222222", "diagnosis_1": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder", "ADL": "True", "median_activity": "Health", "GLAAD": "False", "Gender": "male", "accountCreateDte": "2021-04-08", "DDI_sex": "22.607407407407408", "sarc": "False", "ADDI_age": "37.23703703703705", "diagnosis_2": "Hemochromatosis", "Interest": "cricket, sachin tendulkar, tiger, virat kohli, captain, ms dhoni, kapil dev, mansur ali khan pataudi, ganguly, sunil gawaskar", "ADDI_sex": "31.20555555555555", "id": "00b8f327-04be-436d-a943-665a5b3a2042", "jaccard_score": 4.728521566436604e-05}
