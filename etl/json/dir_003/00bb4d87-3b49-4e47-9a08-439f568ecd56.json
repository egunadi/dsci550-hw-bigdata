Also known as Peruvudaiyar Kovil and RajaRajeswaram, this 11th century temple was built by the Chola emperor Raja Raja Chola I. Cholas are known for their admiration for art.\n\nThe opulence and artistic proficiency of Cholas is well reflected in the grand and magnificent architecture of the temple. Made entirely of granite stone, it was built as per the principles of Vaastu Shastra.\n\nThe most remarkable thing about this UNESCO World Heritage Site is that it doesn\u2019t leave any shadow on the ground at noon. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the temple speaks of the importance of religious beliefs in Hinduism.\n\n#devotion\n# templesofindia", "jaccard_score": 4.378260709663522e-05}
