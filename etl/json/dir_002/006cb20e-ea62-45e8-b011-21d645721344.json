Once there, the team hopes to find the wreck and explore it with two underwater drones.\n\nGetting there won\u2019t be easy. Crushed by pack ice in 1915, the 144-foot-long Endurance is sitting in 10,000 feet of water. And this isn\u2019t just any water: In the Weddell, a swirling current sustains a mass of thick, nasty sea ice that can be a match even for modern icebreakers.\n\nShackleton himself, whose plans to be the first to cross Antarctica were derailed by the loss of his ship, described the site of the sinking as \u201cthe worst portion of the worst sea in the world.\u201d", "DDI_sex": "26.07592592592593", "diagnosis_3": "Acute fatty liver of pregnancy", "median_activity": "Health", "diagnosis_1": "Acute angle closure glaucoma", "GLAAD": "False", "ADDI_sex": "38.53888888888888", "id": "006cb20e-ea62-45e8-b011-21d645721344", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "ADI_sex": "34.144444444444446", "userPrimaryID": "18839", "sarc": "False", "diagnosis_2": "Viral infections", "least_likely_activity": "Hiking", "storyPrimaryID": "79322", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-164399011353178.jpeg", "Age": "19", "sport_event": "['Africa Cup of Nations']", "ADL": "False", "Festivals": "", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
