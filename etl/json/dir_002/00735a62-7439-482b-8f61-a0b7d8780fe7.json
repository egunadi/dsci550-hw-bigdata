Marsch is a major admirer of Aaronson's, according to 90 minutes, and he\naggressively pushed for a transaction to be completed as soon as he was named Marcelo\nBielsa's replacement.\n\nThe Premier League club made an initial \u00a315 million bid, followed by a revised offer of roughly\n\u00a320 million a few days later, but Salzburg were adamant about not selling the US international in\nthe middle of the season.\n\nHowever, they have now accepted a higher offer, and Aaronson is set to become Leeds' first\nsummer signing.\n\nThe agreement will also benefit the Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer, which sold\nAaronson to Salzburg in January 2021.\n\nThe Philadelphia Union are expected to earn a percentage of the transfer price since they secured a sell-on provision when they relocated to Austria.\n\nAaronson headed to Salzburg to play for current Leeds head coach Jesse Marsch. Marsch is\nalso said to be friends with Jim Curtin, Aaronson's Philadelphia manager.\n\nAaronson will play for Leeds and Marsch in the Premier League after they secured their Premier\nLeague status on the last day of the season.\n\nLeeds defeated Brentford 2-1, while relegation rivals Burnley were defeated 2-1 by Newcastle\nUnited.", "median_activity": "Health", "GLAAD": "False", "Gender": "male", "userPrimaryID": "28653", "Interest": "brenden aaronson, rb salzburg, football, news", "ADI_age": "36.71666666666667", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-165329185024454.png", "DDI_sex": "22.607407407407408", "sport_event": "['Six Nations']", "sarc": "False", "least_likely_activity": "Repair", "storyID": "STY1653292006", "ADDI_sex": "31.20555555555555", "Age": "30", "ADL": "False", "id": "00735a62-7439-482b-8f61-a0b7d8780fe7", "Festivals": "", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
