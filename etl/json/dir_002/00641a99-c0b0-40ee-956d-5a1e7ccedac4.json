The unfortunate reality is the Depp Heard case is likely to reinforce the fear that women who come forward with claims of sexual and domestic abuse will encounter a system in which they are unlikely to be believed.\n\nReform is needed to better balance the protection of men\u2019s individual reputations with the rights of women to speak about their experiences.\n\nDefamation a tool of elite men\nDepp was awarded more than US$10 million in damages after convincing the jury Heard was a malicious liar.\n\nThis is despite the fact a UK judge determined in 2020 that it was \u201csubstantially true\u201d Depp had assaulted Heard repeatedly during their relationsh\nAfter the verdict, Heard commented she was \u201cheartbroken that the mountain of evidence still was not enough to stand up to the disproportionate power, influence, and sway\u201d of her famous ex-husband.\n\nHistorically, the common law of defamation was built to protect public men in their professions and trades. It worked to both defend their reputations individually and shut down speech about them as a group.\n\nData from the United States in the late 20th century shows women comprise only 11% of plaintiffs bringing defamation suits.\n\nAs legal scholar Diane Borden has noted, the majority of libel plaintiffs are \u201cmen engaged in corporate or public life who boast relatively elite standing in their communities\u201d.\n\nJohnny Depp waving out of a car\nJohnny Depp won his defamation suit and was awarded more than US$10 million in damages.
