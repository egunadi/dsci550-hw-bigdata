The three points allowed the Dutch women, now under the leadership of Jami M\u00fclders, to regain their position at the top of the FIH Hockey Pro League table.\n\nEngland men began their first foray into the FIH Hockey Pro League with a display of aggressive, attacking hockey as they beat host nation Spain 6-1.\n\nPlayer of the match David Condon spoke of the \u2018aggressive and open style of play\u2019, that his team showed for the majority of this match.\n\nOn paper these are two very closely-matched teams. In nine previous encounters, the results showed three wins apiece, with three draws. This match was a very different affair as England showed a clinical finish that Max Caldas\u2019s team lacked.\u00a0\n\nThe first quarter was goalless as the two teams tested each other out, but then one of six debutants in an England shirt \u2013 Duncan Scott \u2013 opened the scoring with a finely taken penalty corner.\n\nDavid Condon doubled the score in the latter stages of the quarter and then two goals in the third quarter from captain Zach Wallace and James Oats put the game effectively out of Spain\u2019s reach.\u00a0\n\nCondon scored a fifth and then a lovely interchange between Wallace and the experienced Phil Roper created an opportunity for David Goodchild to fire home.\u00a0\n\nSpain scored a consolation goal, but the Red Sticks were unable to repeat some of their earlier Pro League recoveries.\u00a0\n\nIn the women\u2019s match between Spain and the Netherlands, a single goal from the reliable goal machine Frederique Matla was the difference between the two sides.", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-164398913977250.png", "most_likely_activity": "", "Title": "Spain hit for six by England men while Red Sticks women lose out to Matla winner\u00a0", "ADI_age": "33.07222222222222", "ADI_sex": "30.177777777777784", "GLAAD": "False", "storyPrimaryID": "79320", "id": "00792140-b612-4a71-b06c-488789404cd6", "diagnosis_3": "", "storyID": "STY1643989389", "ADDI_sex": "34.87222222222221", "least_likely_activity": "", "sarc": "False", "ADDI_age": "37.23703703703705", "Age": "42", "Gender": "others", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "diagnosis_2": "", "Festivals": "", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.502608567730818e-05}
