Till the time I live, I wish to live with a voice that speaks what I believe without fear. If the price for that is my life, it can be given,\" Manimekalai wrote in a Twitter post in Tamil in response to an article on the controversy.\u00a0\n\nThe Madurai-born filmmaker had shared the poster of \u2018Kaali\u2019 on the microblogging site on Saturday and said the film was part of the 'Rhythms of Canada' segment at the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto.\n\nManimekalai also urged people to watch the film to understand the context behind the poster.\n\nMeanwhile, the row over Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra\u2019s comment on Goddess Kali intensified on Wednesday with a first information report (FIR) being registered against her in Bhopal for allegedly \u201coutraging religious feelings\u201d.\n\n\u201cKaali to me is meat eating... Alcohol accepting Goddess. To me, that is a version of Kaali,\u201d Ms. Moitra had said, to which her party immediately reacted by not only distancing itself from the remark but also condemning it.", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "userID": "USR1608741145", "Interest": "scoop news, recent religious controversies", "jaccard_score": 4.728521566436604e-05}
