They were in the distance. The sky was going orange and red and 15 seconds later you\u2019d hear the explosion so it was some distance away initially. And then it got closer and we heard all across the country reports of explosions,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPeople were initially just panicking and running for cover in some places and the word went out from the president that Russia was invading. He said, \u2018please stay calm.\u2019\u201d\n\nSimmons also said that at the moment \u201cthere is a very eerie atmosphere in the centre of the city\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because we are not sure whether armoured columns are heading in this direction,\u201d he added.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Korrespondent news outlet reported that the traffic jams formed from central Kyiv towards Zhytomyr and other exits from the city at 6am local time (04:00 GMT).\n\nIliya Kusa, an international relations analyst at the Ukrainian Institute for the Future, told Al Jazeera from Kyiv that the fact that \u201cpeople are leaving Kyiv is partially true but it is not a panic wave\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe situation in Kyiv, where I am located now, is more or less stable. There is no panic, there is no critical problems right now. The public transport is working as usual. The only thing that changed actually is that \u2026 schools, universities and kindergartens are closed and hospitals are on high alert since the parliament introduced martial law.\n\nRead more \nhttps://aje.io/hdenvh\n\nCredit :- Aljazeera", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "sarc": "True", "Title": "Russia attack causes panic in Kyiv as people flee", "ADDI_sex": "31.20555555555555", "userPrimaryID": "3618", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "least_likely_activity": "religious education activities (2007+)", "accountCreateDte": "2021-04-05", "jaccard_score": 4.728521566436604e-05}
