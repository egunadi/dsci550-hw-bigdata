In a recent interview on the Smallzy\u2019s Surgery podcast, Louis Tomlinson got real about his feelings toward his former band\u2019s debut project.\n\n\u201cTwelve years ago today the band got formed, but the first album was s\u2013t anyway,\u201d he said at the very beginning of the 14-minute episode\n\nReleased the year after One Direction was formed on The X Factor, Up All Night debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Its lead single \u2014 and the band\u2019s breakout hit \u2014 \u201cWhat Makes You Beautiful\u201d hit No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, while single \u201cOne Thing\u201d reached No. 39.\n\nTomlinson is now gearing up to release his second solo album, which he said on the podcast doesn\u2019t have a release date as of yet. The record will follow 2020\u2019s Walls \u2014 which the 30-year-old \u201cBack to You\u201d singer says was more difficult to make than his current project.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed [making this album] 20 times more than the first album,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s still pressure for me to deliver a good record but there was just so many different opinions on the first album and me trying to find my feet coming out of a band the size of One Direction. So I feel like I\u2019ve been able to look at this record with a bit more clarity.\u201d\n\nAnd though Tomlinson apparently isn\u2019t a fan of all the music he and his One Direction mates made together, he definitely doesn\u2019t feel the same way about the band itself. A few days prior to his appearance on the podcast, he revealed that he\u2019s hopeful for a reunion with Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, and Liam Payne.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be pretty gutted if it\u2019s not, like definitely,\u201d he said on the Australian daytime program Sunrise. \u201cWhat\u2019s the impossible question to answer is when. I\u2019ve got no idea, but I\u2019d be really, really surprised if one day we didn\u2019t. It would be a waste.\u201d", "Age": "19", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "Festivals": "", "storyID": "STY1659474629", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
