It has been claimed that the politicians were inebriated as they were coming out of a bar during the Bharat Jodo Yatra. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">BJP supporter Prabha Upadhyay tweeted the visuals and wrote, &#8220;Rahul Gandhi and senior Congress leaders coming out fully drunk from a local bar in Kerala during Bar Jodo Yatra.&#8221; (<a href=\"https://archive.is/Eqk90\">Archived link</a>)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">( Link https://twitter.com/PrabhaUpadhya21/status/1572509412543332353?t=6Xlhlldcy4SmGmGcs3s9mw&amp;s=19)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rishi Bagree, another BJP supporter, also amplified the footage and wrote that the leaders were all intoxicated and inebriated.

They informed Alt News that they were recorded while walking out of an eatery named &#8216;Malabar Restaurant&#8217; in Kerala&#8217;s Kollam district, where they had gone to have dinner.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Based on this information, we reached out to the manager of the aforementioned restaurant. He revealed that Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders had come to dine at the restaurant. The manager clarified that the establishment was not a bar and did not serve liquor. Along with this, he also sent us the CCTV footage from the same night. The clip clearly shows that Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders were simply having food while seated at the table.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">( Link https://vimeo.com/753245199)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Congress leader Pawan Khera posted a tweet warning Rishi Bagree, who had shared the video out of context, of legal action.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To sum it up, a number of social media users, including several BJP supporters, falsely claimed that Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders were seen leaving a bar in an inebriated state during the &#8216;Bharat Jodo Yatra&#8217;. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Read the full story here:- https://www.altnews.in/false-claim-of-rahul-gandhi-and-senior-leaders-coming-out-drunk-in-kerala-bar-d</p>", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-166471487043646.png", "most_likely_activity": "", "Festivals": "['International Wildlife Film Festival', 'DOK.fest M\u00fcnchen - International Documentary Film Festival Munich', 'Millenium Documentary Film Festival - Brussels', 'DOXA Documentary Film Festival', 'Freiburger Film Forum', 'Riverrun International Film Festival', 'Corti a Ponte - International Short Film Festival', 'Votkinsk International Film Festival', 'Moscow International Children\u2019s Film Festival', 'South African Film Festival - Australia & NZ', 'Krasnogorski International Film Festival', 'Cascadia International Women\u2019s Film Festival', 'Minneapolis St. Paul International Film Festival']", "ADI_sex": "30.177777777777784", "ADI_age": "27.866137566137564", "Age": "13", "GLAAD": "False", "userPrimaryID": "6002", "diagnosis_3": "", "userID": "USR1621001693", "ADDI_sex": "34.87222222222221", "least_likely_activity": "", "id": "002c9863-0fc4-4734-a365-68d26c9d8d64", "Interest": "Technology, History, Food, Economy, Entertainment, Sports, Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics, Climate change ", "sarc": "True", "Gender": "others", "storyID": "STY1664715002", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "Title": "No, viral video doesn\u2019t show Rahul and Cong leaders inebriated during Bharat Jodo Yatra", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "diagnosis_2": "", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.8528694245038994e-05}
