And among them, 89 percent reported of drinking black tea. Tea's strength and portion size were not assessed in the process. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The researchers listed down the benefits of daily tea drinking as observed regardless of if the participants drank coffee&#160; if they added milk or sugar to their tea, or if they preferred tea temperature or genetic variants that's related to caffeine metabolism. <br>\nThe experts had explained about the research as follows: </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Amy Gorin, MS, RDN, an inclusive plant-based dietitian in Stamford, Connecticut, and owner of &#8220;Plant Based with Amy\", says that, &#8220;This study brings home how beneficial black tea can be to our health and mortality\". </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Amy Bragagnini, MS, RD, CSO, an oncology nutrition specialist at Trinity Health Lacks Cancer Center in Michigan and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, adds to the statement that the new research is in line with the findings done previously. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;Many studies have found that polyphenols found in tea (polyphenols are compounds that we get from certain plant-based foods) can act as antioxidants in our body,&#8221; Bragagnini told Healthline. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;These can help reduce oxidative damage in our cells and may help lower the risk of several chronic diseases (cardiovascular diseases and diabetes). The polyphenols may also act as anti-inflammatory agents, which could help lessen joint pain and arthritis,&#8221; she said. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sources - Healthline </p>", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "sarc": "False", "userID": "USR1636129528", "Title": "Black tea adds on our life, study states them \u2615\ufe0f", "ADDI_sex": "31.20555555555555", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-16618746464052.png", "id": "0026ddbf-15d5-46a9-8c1b-5a631f8a4f4a", "Age": "26", "jaccard_score": 4.728521566436604e-05}
