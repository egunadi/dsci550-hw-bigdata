This is supposed to protect the rights of the minority. According to Biden, \u201cIf the filibuster gets in the way, it\u2019s like voting rights,\u201c adding that there should be an \u201cexception to the filibuster for this action to deal with the supreme court decision\u201d.\nBut many on the left charge Republicans and some centrist Democrats with using the rule more in the archaic, Spanish-derived sense of the word \u201cfilibuster\u201d \u2013 as pirates or raiders, ransacking the political process for their purpose.\n\nWith the Senate split 50-50 and controlled by the vote of the vice-president, Kamala Harris, Democrats\u2019 legislative options are hampered.\nBiden is therefore under pressure to take executive action to protect abortion rights. Although his options are few, in Madrid he said he would meet governors on Friday to talk about the issue and would \u201chave announcements to make then\u201d.\nBiden also repeated severe criticism of the decision to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling which guaranteed the right to abortion, and reiterated his warning that other constitutional protections could be in danger from a supreme court leaned right by three justices appointed by Donald Trump. \u201cOne thing that has been destabilizing is the outrageous behavior of the supreme court of the United States in overruling not only Roe v Wade but essentially challenging the right to privacy.\u201d\n\nSource: The Guardian", "Festivals": "['SXSW 2022']", "ADI_sex": "30.177777777777784", "userID": "USR1647325059", "GLAAD": "False", "Interest": "Politics, us, joe biden, abortion rights", "diagnosis_3": "", "ADI_age": "36.71666666666667", "ADDI_sex": "34.87222222222221", "least_likely_activity": "", "id": "00ce1cff-4853-497f-8fb4-d0c882697e65", "accountCreateDte": "2022-03-15", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-165662553583294.png", "sarc": "True", "userPrimaryID": "29008", "Gender": "", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "ADL": "False", "diagnosis_2": "", "median_activity": "", "storyPrimaryID": "111241", "jaccard_score": 3.8528694245038994e-05}
