I didn't know what to do or whom to call. It felt like a nightmare.\u201d\n\n\nTwelve hours after she spoke with us, Fatima\u2019s nightmare came true, as municipal backhoe excavators arrived at her home in the city of Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and began demolishing it. Officials removed the family\u2019s belongings, as pro-government television channels rummaged in the debris and displayed flags and posters found within. \u201cWhen injustice becomes law rebellion becomes duty,\u201d read one.\n\n\nThe police accused Fatima\u2019s father Javed Mohammad, a member of the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind and a prominent face of civil society in the city, of organising the protests in Prayagraj and arrested him. It was one of many towns and cities where Indian Muslims protested, sometimes violently, against slurs made by former BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma against Prophet Mohammad during a television debate. \n\n\nFatima said she believed she was mentally prepared for the backlash that she knew her outspokenness would inevitably trigger, but when the reaction came late on the night of 11 June 2022, she was at a loss about what to do and whom to call. \n\n\nIn her five years as a student activist, Fatima said she had envisioned many scenarios, even joking with her father, Javed Mohammad, a leader of the Welfare Party of India and a fellow critic of India\u2019s current government, what they would do if the authorities came for them.\n\nread more - https://article-14.com/post/-it-could-happen-to-any-muslim-family-a-student-activist-on-her-father-s-arrest-demolition-of-her-home-62a5e50c79ac1", "storyID": "STY1655104370", "Gender": "others", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "sport_event": "[' UCI Road World Championships']", "storyPrimaryID": "106831", "diagnosis_2": "", "Festivals": "", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.8528694245038994e-05}
