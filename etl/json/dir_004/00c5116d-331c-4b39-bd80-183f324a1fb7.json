The schools in question have declined to comment or said only that they\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Here, Robert Massa, a professor of higher education at the University of Southern California, provides insights into what the case is about.\n\nIs this the latest \u2018admissions scandal\u2019?\n\nAlthough it may be tempting to brand this case as the latest college admissions \u201cscandal,\u201d this lawsuit harks back to an investigation of 57 private, four-year universities conducted over 30 years ago by the Department of Justice on charges of \u201cprice fixing.\u201d In this case, price fixing means limiting how the colleges compete for students by agreeing with one another to offer similar financial aid awards to admitted students.\n\nBack then, groups of these colleges would meet to review the financial aid packages that each college had offered to students. The colleges stated that they did this to assure that each school in the group based their awards on the same financial information from the student, such as family income, number of students in college, non-custodial parent and the like, so that students could select schools based on which school was best for them instead of which school offered the best deal. The colleges did this by all offering aid that would make the price paid the same at each school.\n\nThe government, citing Section I of the Sherman Antitrust Act, disagreed. It claimed the practice of sharing financial aid information on students limited competition and, in so doing, had the potential to lead to higher prices for students because without competition, there would theoretically be no reason to attempt to \u201coutbid\u201d a member of the group.\n\nRead full story at The Conversation: https://theconversation.com/colleges-accused-of-conspiring-to-make-low-income-students-pay-more-174686\n\nImage Courtesy: https://www.gettyimages.com/license/1264389817?adppopup=true", "median_activity": "Food", "ADL": "False", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
