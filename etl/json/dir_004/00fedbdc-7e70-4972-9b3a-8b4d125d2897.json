Now according to new studies if a teenager doesn't get a sufficient amount of sleep then they maybe at risk for increased health problems like obesity and high blood pressure. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The research presented at the ESC Congress 2022 states that those adolescents who sleep for less than eight hours a night is more likely to be at risk for these health conditions. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As per the study it found only 34 percent of 12 years old got eight hours of sleep. And the percentage dropped down to 24 percent and to 19 percent at 14 and 16 years. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Children who got less than 7 hours of sleep were 21% more likely to have obesity at age 12 and 72% more likely age age 14, compared to children who got over 8 hours of sleep. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dr. Louis Morledge, an internist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, said that, &#8220;Sleep should be regarded as a pillar of comprehensive healthcare, complementing nutrition and physical activity on a daily basis in order to maintain optimal health\". \"Americans young and old would benefit from a good night&#8217;s sleep in addition to eating a healthy diet and regularly engaging in physical activity for overall health.&#8221; </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now what's the connection between sleep and health issues like these? Let's find it out. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So by missing out sleep can cause an imbalance in the hormones which regulates appetite and metabolism. Studies have proven that with sleep restriction there is an increased rate of hunger and appetite, especially for foods that's high in calories. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Heather Turgeon and Julie Wright, psychotherapists, authors, and sleep experts, said that, &#8220;Being sleep deprived makes you feel like you&#8217;re hungry, and makes you crave and reach for unhealthy foods\". </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;Sleep loss can also cause chronic inflammation because the brain and body are left in a continual state of stress. That has a direct impact on immediate and long-term health.&#8221;<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sources - Healthline </p>", "median_activity": "Health", "ADL": "True", "GLAAD": "False", "Gender": "male", "sport_event": "['ICC World T20 (men)', 'AIBA World Championships (men)']", "userPrimaryID": "10196", "DDI_sex": "22.607407407407408", "Interest": "Technology, History, Economy, Food, Entertainment, Climate change , Sports, Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics", "Festivals": "['Purbeck Film Festival', 'Leiden International Film Festival', 'Tokyo International Film Festival', 'Banff Centre Mountain Film and Book Festival', 'Tokyo International Film Festival', 'Brauschweig International Film Festival', 'Climate Crisis Film Festival', 'Film Festival Cottbus', 'Abertoir International Horror Festival of Wales 1', 'Aesthetica Short Film Festival', 'L\u00fcbeck Nordic Film Days', 'The Valley Film Festival', 'Ibero American Film Festival', 'Denver Film Festival', 'Les Gai Cine Mad', 'UK Green Film Festival', 'Leeds International Film Festival', 'Sydney Film Festival', 'Miami GEMS Film Festival', 'FILMZ - Festival des deutschen Kinos', 'Belfast Film Festival', 'Ankara Film Festival', 'Hawaii International Film Festival', 'Belo Horizonte International Short Film Festival', 'Arlington International Film Festival', 'Ojai International Film Festival', 'London Korean Film Festival', 'Mezipatra Queer Film Festival', 'Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival', 'Buffalo Dreams Fantastic Film Festival', 'Geneva International Film Festival', 'Arras Film Festival', 'MedFilm Festival', 'Thessaloniki International Film Festival', 'New Orleans Film Festival', 'Cork International Film Festival']", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "Title": "Less than 8 hours of sleep will lead to development of health conditions like obesity among teens", "sarc": "False", "userID": "USR1636129528", "ADDI_sex": "31.20555555555555", "storyID": "STY1661952926", "Age": "26", "jaccard_score": 4.728521566436604e-05}
