I read this book more than 2 years ago for the very first time but a part of my heart is still stuck within the pages of this book.\n\n\u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d is a heart-wrenching five-star read that will make you fall in love with both the writing and the characters. This story follows Lily Bloom, a 23-year-old-college\u00a0graduate, who is in the midst of starting a new, simple life in Boston where she meets Ryle Kincaid and they eventually fall in love. Bloom\u2019s relationship with Kincaid gets complicated, however, when Bloom runs into her first love, Atlas Corrigan, with whom she had lost contact years before.\u00a0\u00a0Hoover has done amazing work with big plot twists in the book and you will be hooked till the end.\u00a0I originally thought \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d was a romance novel but it is so much more than a book with a fairytale ending or sad-troubled characters.\n\nAs a note of caution, I would recommend looking up the trigger warnings for this book before buying it. Even with such sensitive topics and writings, this is a book I will recommend to almost everyone. Also with the upcoming sequel, \u201cIt Starts With Us\u201d which is slated to be released in October 2022, I\u2019m sure more people will be picking this up.\n\nThe book with its ending is beautiful and necessary \u2014 I could not recommend this book more.\u00a0And if you\u2019ve already read this book, let me know your thoughts too!!\n\nlove, love\u00a0<3", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "diagnosis_2": "", "Title": "Need a book rec!?\nYou are at the right post <3", "jaccard_score": 4.203130281276981e-05}
