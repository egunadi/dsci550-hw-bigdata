Odds of previous-year suicidal ideation were 135% lower in people who began hormones in early adolescence, 62% lower in those who began in late adolescence and 21% lower in those who began as adults,\u201d according to research based on a survey of 27,000 people, led by Stanford.\n\n\nTrans folks have repeatedly emphasized how critically lifesaving gender-affirming care is \u2013 read their stories here: https://bit.ly/33K8DK9 \n\nWV HB 2171 has been carried over from last year\u2019s legislative sessions.", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "id": "00ed3f1a-1185-4d08-b921-c012104a6391", "jaccard_score": 4.728521566436604e-05}
