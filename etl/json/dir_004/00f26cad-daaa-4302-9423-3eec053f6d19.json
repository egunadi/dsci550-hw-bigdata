The cinematography, plot and the performances by the actor are all phenomenal.\nAnd not to mention Stanley Kubrik\u2019s direction of the film which left everyone who watched the film with a lot of questions. One of the most common questions is that of the image at the end of the movie before the credits.\n\nSo, what does the photo mean?\n\nWe can clearly see Jack Torrance in that photo, but the weird thing is that the photo was taken in 1921. There are two theories as to what it might mean.\n\nThe first theory suggest that what if Jack is not actually Jack at all, but a reincarnation of a spirit of the Overlook hotel, possibly the manifestation of the hotel itself who brings people back into the hotel in order to reenact an even which took place in 1921. This theory would be supported by that Jack has always been the caretaker and that Delbert Grady has always been the butler. This would also explain why all the other ghosts recognise him and turn him on his family with such ease. We also have to consider that Grady os a shared name between the butler and Charles Grady the previous caretaker who killed the family before Jack and his family arrived. \n\nThe other theory suggests that Jack may be Jack, a real person but the hotel calls to people like him who have damaged pasts in order to add them to its collection. The Grady name might be a coincidence and the only thing shared between these three men is the potential murder of their loved ones. So, when Jack dies the hotel consumes his spirit and make him live in the hotel for eternity.\nBut this makes you wonder how many guests have met this same fate.\n\nStanley himself stated that the Ballroom picture suggest the reincarnation of Jack. The clever use of the word \u201csuggest\u201d could mean one of two things. Either he has been reincarnated to draw people in or he has been reincarnated in the picture.", "most_likely_activity": "", "ADI_sex": "30.177777777777784", "ADI_age": "27.866137566137564", "GLAAD": "False", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-165669788512037.jpeg", "diagnosis_3": "", "ADDI_sex": "34.87222222222221", "least_likely_activity": "", "Festivals": "['Doc Edge 2022', 'Sheffield Docfest 2022']", "accountCreateDte": "2022-06-28", "sarc": "True", "storyPrimaryID": "111932", "userPrimaryID": "49690", "Gender": "", "userID": "USR1656398821", "id": "00f26cad-daaa-4302-9423-3eec053f6d19", "DDI_sex": "24.34166666666667", "ADL": "False", "Age": "17", "diagnosis_2": "", "median_activity": "", "jaccard_score": 3.8528694245038994e-05}
