A little later Andrew Card, his chief of staff, whispered in the president&#8217;s right ear: &#8220;A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.&#8221; To keep the president out of harm&#8217;s way, Bush subsequently hopscotched across the country on&#160;Air Force One, landing in Washington, D.C., the evening of the attacks. At 8:30&#160;PM&#160;Bush addressed the nation from the Oval Office in a speech that laid out a key&#160;doctrine&#160;of his administration&#8217;s future foreign policy: &#8220;We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.&#8221;</p>", "diagnosis_3": "Carbon monoxide poisoning", "ADI_age": "33.07222222222222", "median_activity": "Health", "GLAAD": "False", "Gender": "male", "Interest": "Technology, History, Food, Entertainment, Sports, Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics, Economy, Climate change ", "DDI_sex": "22.607407407407408", "id": "00cfd19d-de72-4fad-a599-9853818c1399", "sarc": "False", "diagnosis_1": "Myocarditis", "ADDI_age": "37.23703703703705", "Title": "21 years on, 9/11: When President George Bush  was briefed about  it", "least_likely_activity": "Organizing", "storyID": "STY1662875571", "ADDI_sex": "31.20555555555555", "accountCreateDte": "2020-11-17", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
