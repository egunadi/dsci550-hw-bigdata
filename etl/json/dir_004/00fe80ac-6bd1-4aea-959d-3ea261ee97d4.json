With Charles Leclerc winning the race and Carlos Sainz finishing second, this gives Ferrari their first 1-2 since Singapore, 2019.\n\nJoining them on the podium was Mercedes\u2019 Lewis Hamilton who finished third after both Red Bull drivers Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez were forced to retire their cars.\n\nWhile there were many highlights to the race, the two biggest winners were Ferrari and F1 itself. The raceability of the new cars has been significantly improved. It thus allowed for more exciting, more frequent and closer racing.\n\nThis race gives us hope for an entertaining era of Formula 1 ahead of us. Mercedes looks like they\u2019re still struggling to match the pace of the Red Bulls and the Ferraris. However it would be foolish to write them off this early into the season.\n\nAt the moment, Ferrari appear to be the team to beat. While the Red Bull cars were strong, only one of the 4 Honda powered cars actually finished the race yesterday. This could be seriously worrying for the Milton-Keynes-based outfit.\n\nWill Ferrari finally have their first champion since 2007? Will Red Bull overcome looming engine reliability issues to help Max Verstappen defend his title?\nThis and more will be answered as the Formula 1 circus moves forward.\n\nThe next race will be this week in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.", "DDI_sex": "22.607407407407408", "ADI_age": "42.805555555555564", "accountCreateDte": "2020-11-19", "sarc": "False", "Interest": "f1, Sports, ferrari, bahrain gp", "storyPrimaryID": "88582", "ADDI_sex": "31.20555555555555", "Media": "https://image.pixstory.com/Pixstory-image-164783090831810.jpeg", "userID": "USR1605786305", "ADL": "False", "sport_event": "", "least_likely_activity": "religious education activities (2007+)", "jaccard_score": 4.553391138050063e-05}
