But...but...   I just swallowed 56 zygotes so that they could vote by proxy through me for the Ripofflican(tm) party this upcoming election so they can win. Now I'm going to have all that indigestion for nothin'.   As to driving...don't care.   What I'll miss most is all of those credit card offers that come in their names. There's just so much that they, living though me want to 'buy now and pay later' on. You saying they can't do that?   But, that's just the argument Chem99a and I are having in another thread.   And this is what it devolves down into.   Parasite attached to a human and one that's coaxes it (often with governmental support) to nurish it...not much difference.   Personally, I'd rather have the sucker permanently attached to me so I'm not forced to think about feeding it or changing it's diaper. I'd also take a kick to the ribs over cholic crying.   Silly neglegence laws...   Yep.   I do think some would be willing to work towards compromises that would make the most happy. Jitobear seems to be one from my observations.   But, others want it their way.   I dislike abortion but can see in some circumstances that there really isn't much of an alternative. I also see that most anti-abortionists often don't help to provide alternatives.   I don't want to make it illegal per se but do want to work towards reducing the instrances in which a woman would see it as a more viable alternative.   It'd be nice if society and science would progress to that point.   But, since it isn't and since I'm evil(tm), kill it.   Go ahead...be a murderer.   Muahahahaha.   Evil WINS!   Go evil, go evil, go evil...   Um, isn't evil subjective?
