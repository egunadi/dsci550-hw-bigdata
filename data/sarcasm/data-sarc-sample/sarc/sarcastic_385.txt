Do you have any evidence that this is so? Why would they be totally useless - is it just because you can't imagine a use?   Why do you think that a small, quick dinosaur with relatively long arms (not like the short useless arms of T. rex that couldn't even reach its mouth) with three very sharp claws would be useless? Look at this picture.   http://research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather18.jpg   Those don't look like totally useless masses to me. The problem is that you imagine that wings sprouted from nothing and must have been useless until they were fully formed as you think they should be. That's not the case. They didn't spring from nothing as useless masses. They were the front limbs, with quite impressively clawed, grasping hands. They could have even been used for climbing, as is the case of hoatzins that have claws on their wings until they get their primary flight feathers. The could have been used for grasping food that they were able to catch because of the speed assist from imprefectly formed wings.   You propose yet another "I just can't imagine how it happened so it must not be true" creationist argument.
