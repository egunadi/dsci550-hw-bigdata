What illogical tripe.   The above is factually not true.   It's also the garbage that the Word of Faith movement hangs on to get people to conform to their message.   Seriously, I act like a 13 year old quite often...I only WISH I'd become one...simply becasue youth is wasted on the young.   I also act like a God. Flexing my might and power on a whim.   I'm still waiting for adoration and worship.   There is no 'act' there either IS or IS NOT.
