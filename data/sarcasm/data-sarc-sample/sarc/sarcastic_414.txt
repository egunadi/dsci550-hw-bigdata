You are on some different planet there. Science doesn't need one conclusion or the other. The traditional classification of neandertals has been Homo sapiens neanderthalensis, i.e., in the same species. Then genetic work suggested that neandertals were distinct enough to merit being a separate species [Hodges, S. B., 2000, Human Evolution: A start for population genomics. Nature (7 Dec. 2000): 408(6813):652-653.]. Results since then have been mixed. Some DNA work indicates a 5% admixture from Neandertals (Plagnol V, Wall JD, 2006, Possible ancestral structure in human populations. PLoS Genetics @ http://genetics.plosjournals.org/per...20105.eor&amp;ct=1 ). Various fossils continue to suggest some interbreeding. (Note also that a genetic finding of no interbreeding does not conflict with fossilized hybrids - it merely says that any hybrids or hybrid lines ended up dying out before they contributed to any lineages that were successful all the way to the present.)   A finding of 99.5 to 99.9% genetic similarity is what we expect, given the clear similarity of the two groups.
