Color is a function of the wavelength of light. Thus, quantum considerations aside, there are a nigh infinite number of colors. Humans, of course, can only see a subset of those colors, ranging from about 400 to 700 nanometers. In particular, our eyes have cells "tuned" to three ranges of wavelengths; blue, red, and green. You could think of those as short, medium, and long wavelengths. By extrapolating from the relativity intensities from the particular cells we can "figure out" what wavelength is entering our eyes.   http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tut...perception.htm   Does this dispell your confusion?   Edit:   And just to address one other point, scientists are well aware of the limitations of the human eye. That's why, when exact determination of color is important, machines that can read precise wavelengths are used, rather than relying on the known to be limited instrument which is the human eye.
