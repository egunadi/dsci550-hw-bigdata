I love this line. I assume by "harm" you mean an actual physical harm or some kind or another (physical in this case includes loss of items). So this would cut our laws in half. Walk around naked? No big deal! Have sex on the street why doing cocaine...go for it! Drunk in public? Who cares!   The list can go on forever.
