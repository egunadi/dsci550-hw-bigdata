and a brain with no body kept on life support is only a brain...no person. If beg the question here. I deny that a level of intelligence is needed to deserve rights. I disagree that what you can do is a requirement..only what you are (that being a human).   Still, I quoted you as saying "a basic human fundamental right"...I am not sure what this right is or where it comes from or why it is fundamental or why it only applies to the humans you think it should apply to. Perhaps we should restrict it to only white folks again...after all, white folks are the only humans with white skin which makes them different from all other wildlife...right?
