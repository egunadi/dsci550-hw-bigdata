Just helping something live doesn't affect evolution unless it affects the ability to reproduce viable offspring.   If there was no nylon before the 1940s and there is an organism that can survive by eating NOTHING else, what does that tell you? There could not have been a population of nylon-eating bacteria before 1940. This is a new population that did not exist before.
