How can they? If they exist in the mind and not on there own, then I can chose not do think about or believe in these laws (Bivalency, Involution, Idempotency,Identity, (Non-)Contradiction, Excluded Middle, Contraction, Commutatively, DeMorgan's, Associatively, Distributivity) and they stop existing? Or I could say, "hofflenosh" is a concept I think is stupid and does not exist, come to think of it, the law of excluded middle is a stupid concept so it does not exist either. If is existed only in the mined, it would not be absolute. It would be your opinion of the law of logic existing against someone that says they do not exist.
