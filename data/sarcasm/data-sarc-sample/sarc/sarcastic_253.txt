Utter XXXX. Doctors will regularly provide advice on lifestyle changes to those at risk of a variety of diseases and conditions, contact information as to where they can find support in making those lifestyle changes, and if appropriate refer them to psychologists to assist them in making those changes. Dentists will give long lectures on the evils of eating sugar and suggest appropriate snack replacements for sugary foods.   What else does "walking the walk" entail? Should the "medical establishment" follow their patients around and forcibly prevent them from having a lifestyle they believe to be harmful?   Then why aren't doctors who advise rest and plenty of fluids for a cold in jail? Oh right, because you're lying, as usual.   Doctors ARE schooled in nutrition, however inadequately, this doesn't mean they're going to recommend crackpot "raw food" dietary schemes to prevent destructive "lamarckian evolution" on the basis of a single flawed experiment on cats.
