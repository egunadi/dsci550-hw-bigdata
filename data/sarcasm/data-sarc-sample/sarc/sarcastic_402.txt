If you had bothered to spend more than two seconds actually looking up what happened, you would've seen that Joe Horn was cleared of all wrong doings by a grand jury, not on the grounds of the new Castle Doctrine of Texas, but the already existing laws that permits the use of deadly force for preventing property crimes. These laws were on the books for years before Texas officially adopted the NRA endorsed Castle Doctrine.   And even so, what're you complaining about? Would you rather Joe Horn be the one killed and the criminals alive today?
