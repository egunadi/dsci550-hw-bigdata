And you don't have any picture. You have no idea of what recessive really means, do you. Actually, since the first observation of a black peppered moth in 1848, several other mutations have caused other variations of color in peppered moths. They are intermediate between the typica and the carbonaria, but they are extremely rare. These alleles form a hierarchy of dominence in which the carbonaria is the full dominant, and the typica is fully recessive.   Please define "kind." Please define "variation." Please explain the origin of this "variation in kind."
