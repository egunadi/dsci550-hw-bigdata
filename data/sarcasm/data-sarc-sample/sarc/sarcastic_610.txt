So your saying I have no right to disagree unless I can prove and refute evolution and science. Right, you can come back down to earth now. I can disagree with what I want to and no one an explanation, however that wasn't my intent.   [quote]You have the right to defend yourself, but when you resort to comments such as "get a life" to socialist, we start (or merely confirm our existing notions) that you no idea what you are talking about when you disagree with science and evolution.[quote/]   Oh you mean this comment from Socialist, "I am not considering your points anymore, so In a way I am. I just like making fun of them. It's entertaining".   It's funny how you forgot to include his comment. What scientific answer would you have me give?
