You ask others for their opinion, and then refuse to listen when it's offered.   The truth is that you don't see the analogy as valid.   We do.   We see a situation where, like blacks before, people disapprove of a group of people and want to segregate one group from the other.   Sometimes, they refuse to offer any alternative.   Sometimes, they offer a separate alternative.   That argument cuts both ways.   The question comes up regarding what's YOUR beef on the issue?   Why are you so insistent on maintaining two separate groups?   Is it because you want to reserve marriage as "prestigous" whereby gays are kept out?   Under interracial marriage, no black person was prohibited from marrying either.   Should people have been satisfied with interracial couples being classified as "civil unions"?   Today, we recognize that racism is wrong.   Yet some people still persist with homophobia. They fail to have a historical context on the real meaning of the methodology they recommend.   Frankly, that's like saying "You can't be Jewish, but you can pick any sect of Christianity you want to. You can't wear a star of david, but you can wear a cross.   So that's *equal*"...   You're saying we can marry HETEROSEXUALLY, so HOMOSEXUALS must pretend that's equal???   Makes no sense...   If I call somebody "male", that restricts no rights from them.   It doesn't require they go to a separate place to get their rights.   And quite frankly, insisting on keeping one definition FOR A RIGHT (at the exclusion of gays) is "satisfying the ego" of the homophobic group.   "attack on the definition of marriage"?   Why is it an "attack" to include gay couples in as married?   Would it be an "attack" on something for blacks to not have to be segregated from whites?
