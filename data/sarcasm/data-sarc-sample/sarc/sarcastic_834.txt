Well, let's see.   1 This is a skull from a modern human, the differences representing pathological deformities.   2 The dating is based on disputed methodology. Creation scientists have proved that radioisotope dating is unreliable.   3 The two pieces are only assumed to be from the same individual.   4 Where's the conclusive DNA evidence? (A nod to easyrider on the Religion board.)   5 These claims are made by scientists, and all science is an atheistic conspiracy against religion (thank you marc9000).   6 So where's the missing link between the new fossil and us? Huh? Huh?   Sadly, past experience suggests that creationists can wriggle on indefinitely.
