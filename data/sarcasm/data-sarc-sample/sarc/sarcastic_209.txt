Nothing like quoting experts willing to stick their scientific necks out, huh?   Or in your second quote:   "But it now appears the warming from greenhouse gases has been offset by a strong cooling effect from dimming - in effect two of our pollutants have been cancelling each other out.   This means that the climate may in fact be more sensitive to the greenhouse effect than previously thought."   Huh?
