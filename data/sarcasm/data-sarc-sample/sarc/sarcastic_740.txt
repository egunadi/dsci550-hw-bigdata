Since when? So if I were to post a news article where someone says that pedophilia should be legalized, then it means I agree with them? I thought this was a discussion board. That means we, you know, DISCUSS THINGS.   Now, if I had said "Here is AiG's article and I couldn't agree with them more", then you would have an argument.   As I did not, you don't. Now, do you retract your false statement that what you quoted was my reasoning?
