Well, the short version is that shortly after the big bang, the universe was filled by a hot quark plasma. As it expanded and cooled, the process of nucleosynthesis produced the primordial elemental abundance, primarily hydrogen, with some deutirium, helium, and lithium. The physics is well understood, and verified by observation. Quantifying uncertainties in primordial nucleosynthesis without Monte Carlo simulations   At roughly a billion years of age, stars and galaxies formed, some fraction of the stars that formed were massive supergiants, that burned up their hydrogen into other elements, up to the atomic number of iron. This occurred at a tremendous rate and in a few more billion years, these stars went supernova and exploded. Prior to going supernova, these stars go through a phase where the outer layers of the star are shed, providing ways to transport the lighter elements away from the star. You can see this in the following link:   Hubble Chemically Analyzes the Ring around Supernova 1987A   The trememdous radiation of the supernova permits the formation of elements with atomic numbers higher than iron. The force of these explosions scattered the newly created elements, creating vast gas and dust clouds. Eventually, the shockwave of another explosion initiated the collapse of one of these clouds, and the spinning hydrogen cloud begins to heat , eventually initiating nuclear fusion, and becoming our sun. As the sun began to increase it's heat output, the volatile remains of the accretion disk are driven away from the inner portion of the solar system, leaving mostly heavy elments. Comets bombarded the inner solar system, transporting water, carbon, and amino acids to the newly forming earth, making dirt.   In short, a truely wonderful creation.
