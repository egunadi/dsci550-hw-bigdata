Good lesson! Always take the easy way out to try and avoid consequences of actions. Instead of leaving a note on a car saying you accidently hit you...you should just casually drive away. Thanks Simone!   probably because this is an abortion forum and not a forum about the Iraq War..not only that, there is no parallel.   the fetus would be a real person...and it seems like....in order to make the iraq war/abortion connection....you would have to support the war!
