Funny. It is you who have "abso-freaking-lutely" no qualms about forcing gays and lesbians to pony up dough for Mr and Mrs. John Q Taxpayers marriage and divorce, all the whie denying them the chance to follow the same course as Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.   You my friend are a complete hypocrite. Either give them marriage or quite taxing them to help yours.   On another topic, I find it sad that you were ever given the position of moderator with your hateful and dishonest posts like this one. Very glad that it was stripped from you.
