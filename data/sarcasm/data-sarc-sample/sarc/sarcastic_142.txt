And by old fashion I assume you mean Greece a couple of thousand years ago. That's the only place and time I can think of off hand where the populace (by which I mean landed men in this case) could vote to change laws. In this country the correct procedure for a citizen to change an unjust law is via the courts, and always has been.   However, I don't think that is, in fact, what Jyoshu was refering to.
