You're getting rusty NATO.   It was a college campus. Guns ARE banned where this happened.   Maybe simone can explain yet another instance of a shooting in a "gun free zone"?   How many of these shootings on "gun free" college campuses need to happen before we ever get a comment on how these bans are working so well?   I mean, after an average of once a week, you would think suggesting banning guns would be a laughable suggestion. Yet, after every shooting where guns are completely banned, there seems to be a suggestion that we need stricter gun control. How do you get tighter than 100% forbidden?   Anyone care to state the definition of insanity for posterity?
