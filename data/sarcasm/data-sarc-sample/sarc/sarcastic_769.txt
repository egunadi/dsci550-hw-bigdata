Of course, when wabbit says "dishonesty," he means "oversimplification"; the NMSR webpage is clearly designed for the layperson, not the geneticist. When he says "scientist," he means "shameless hack." Spetner argued that this is not an example of an increase in information until he had it repeatedly and undeniably shown to meet Spetner's own definition of information. Only now has he said, "Okay, so it's an increase, therefore it's not random." Classic moving the goalposts syndrome.   But if wabbit would like to continue leaning on Spetner as a "reliable source," I won't stop him. More fun for me.
