There is no god that supports the forcing of women to suffer and carry out unplanned pregnancies, just because some PL advocate spits it our. "Sorry, were going to force you to give birth, those men over there have decided".   Thats as ridiculous as saying "There is no god to condones the slaughter of thousands of innocent life forms inside of the cut" (referring to disinfecting a cut).   Pro-lifers have been dropped on their head too many times.
