Please, I beg you, stop trying to jam the world into your "creation" account through reason. You just won't get anywhere through reason, if your first choice is to believe the bible (any religious works) as truth, and go from there.   What you just said is "[adaptation] would be mutation by natural selection, not evolution"   First, the adaptation refers to the adaptation of the species. A population of wingless beetles survives. The missing wings is the mutation, and isn't caused by anything other than a mutation, it's not a result of their being winds, or there being a god, it's just a mutation in the gene code.   The gene for the wings can dissappear into the endless gulf of other discarded mutations since those organisms that carry it will most likely die off before reproductive age. It can also be left in the DNA sequence, unused, and not active, unless some other mutation activates it. ( A large percentage of our DNA seems to be unused garbage code).   When this happens, your species evolved. What is your point, that beetles can evolve? Yes, they do. All life on earth seems to. Yet you don't think it's due to evolution? Mind-boggling. Who is telling you evolution is "bad" or "wrong"? Only if you arrive at that conclusion WITHOUT religion, can you even begin to have a discussion on it.   Evolution in life only requires:   DNA replication   Mutations   A natural environment (that is, what we see here on earth, a complex system)   time   Which of these do you feel is "incorrect"? We can prove any of these, why persist?   -Mach
