No, billsco, I've never had an insight which would reveal the creationist mindset in the way you describe: I wouldn't mind seeing an occasional imp or two on my ceiling.   I've also wondered (like Waxy) about the motives of the scientists who at first patiently, and then satirically, address the "arguments" of the religious enthusiasts who so desperately want to trash evolution. Are the resident biologists performing an altruistic service or just entertaining spectators like me ?
