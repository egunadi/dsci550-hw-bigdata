Once cannot abort a pregnancy if it has not begun.   The morning after pill prevents a pregnancy from ever occuring by preventing the fertilized egg from implanting.   If one considers pregnancy to begin at conception (i.e. fertilization of the egg), then petri dishes are pregnant when eggs are fertilized on them ("conception") for later IVF.   Do we really want to be considering petri dishes pregnant?
