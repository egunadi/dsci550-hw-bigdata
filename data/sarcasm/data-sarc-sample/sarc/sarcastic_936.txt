Yes, it seems you never learn, so I have no hope of educating you, and absolutely no intention.   Since you ask nicely, the answer is "Supreme soveriegn authority", i.e. the fact that governments are established among men to secure their basic rights-- i.e. they not left to individual whims to respect or violate as each pleases, in the model of classic anarchy.   States are thus delegated by their People, with the power to to protect these rights through laws.   I believe we've gone over this before; you didn't understand it then, I doubt you will now... or ever. It's still true, however: ignorance is never disproof.   If you form your own nation, you can name yourself the sovereign and construe the laws however you choose; however that's neither here nor there.
