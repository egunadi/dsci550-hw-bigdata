You are SO insulting.   "Oh, the poor dears have been through too much and are considering an action I disagree with so they must not be thinking clearly."   Who are you to say they aren't thinking clearly? I'll give it to you, Bassman. You are the most polite, best veiled misogynist I have ever encountered. You nearly had me fooled.
