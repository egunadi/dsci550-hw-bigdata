Way to miss the entire point, Clerisian.   My point was that is it a horrible experience for many women, and that I wish we could strive towards a society where abortions were no longer needed. Wishful thinking by a midtwenties female who just went through the most horrifying experience of her life, forgive me if I didn't clarify well enough.   I can't imagine that anyone would disagree with that.
