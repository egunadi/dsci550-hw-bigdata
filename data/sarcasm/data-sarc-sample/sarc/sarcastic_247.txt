so we are making progress. It seems that SS is now admitting that evolution by natural selection really does happen. He admits that his examples are not what he claims they are.   We also see that he objects for religious rather than scientific reasons and is aware of it. Good for you SS.   Sadly, he seems to be falling back on that old creationist saw about "where are the intermediates."
