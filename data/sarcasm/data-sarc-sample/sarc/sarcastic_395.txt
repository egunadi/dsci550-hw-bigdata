Well, I see that Hunter continues with his intentional ignorance. Even though it has been explained to him on several occasions, he still chants his "evolution is only a theory" mantra in hopes that his audience will be as ignorant as he.   Yes, evolution is a theory. In science that means that it has been tested and accepted as essentially correct. Evolution is a theory just as gravity is a theory - several in fact; Newtonian gravity, general relativity, and quantum gravity. None of those theories actually work in all situations.   But for all practical purposes, evolution has been proven. That's easy since evolution has been observed and the theories are build on the facts of those observations.   You will notice that Hunter hasn't proven any of his assertions. He just knows that there are talking snakes, and magical beings that make people out of dirt. Sure - go ahead and start with the Bible so you can get the mythology of two different creation stories, an impossible flood, and such fantasies as a man being swallowed by a whale or the any human would know about a god that wagers with Satan, out of the way. Not only will you find no proof to support the Bible, you won't evern find any evidence.
