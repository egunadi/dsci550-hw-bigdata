Really? So, university presidents and trustees -- the overwhelming majority of whom have no connection with evolution, and most of whom are considerably more politically conservative than university faculties -- are behind the whole thing? Wow.   You know, this sort of claim requires evidence. I would like see your evidence of university administration involvement. Got any?   And who are the "top" in the peer-review process? Editors? Please explain what you mean.
