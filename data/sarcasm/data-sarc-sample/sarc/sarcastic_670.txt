Really? Then why did you start off your little rant by admitting that "...microevolution cannot be reasonably disputed." Evolution has been observed, and that is a fact. Speciation in both plants and animals has been observed, and that is a fact. Apparently you don't know what a theory is. Might it not be wise to learn just a little about science before you make yourself look so foolish? Theories explain facts.
