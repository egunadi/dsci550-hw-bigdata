And of course, the theory of gravity isn't "physically" proven either. Neither is the heliocentric theory or atomic theory or the germ theory of disease.

As far as your mangling of the "Out of Africa" theory, it would be nice if you actually learned what you are talking about before you babble such nonsense.
