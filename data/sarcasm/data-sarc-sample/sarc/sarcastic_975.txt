The ATF declared both .30 cal M2 AP and 5.56mm M855 Ball (w/steel penetrator) to be "non-AP" rounds.   For those of you that have a problem with law abiding citizens having and using "AP" ammo....wake up! We ARE law abiding so what are you worried about.....or do you think I don't "need" it? If so..who are you to tell me what I "need"?   I have a rifle match next month...I think I'll go load up some AP for it since AP tends to shoot better in my M1 than regular Ball. :D
