Is that what you said right before they started banning assault weapons? 'Oh, let's just see what Sarah Brady wants to do?' Obviously, you're gullible. Since you're such a brainiac and all, why don't you visit the UN website and see what your beloved UN is up to?   And again, read this slower this time (if that helps) 'On the other hand, not one acceptable reason for individuals owning guns is mentioned.'
