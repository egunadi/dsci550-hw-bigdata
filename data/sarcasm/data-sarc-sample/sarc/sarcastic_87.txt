You know what?   You're officially too clueless to post on this thread.   You obviously haven't bothered yourself to figure out what's going on, so I'm going to kindly ask that you leave until you figure out what is going on.   As I escort you out the door (metaphorically), let me just repeat something for you that was in the FIRST SENTENCE of the article that you obviously couldn't be bothered to read...   I'll even make it nice and big so maybe it will help with your reading comprehension!   collect detailed data about each abortion performed --   and post it all on a public Web site.   Feel free to rejoin us when you figure out what's going on.
