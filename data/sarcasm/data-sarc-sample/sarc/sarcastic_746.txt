You think its bad now? Watch what happens if Gov't takes control. I saw a great tagline the other day, it said "If the US get socialized medicine where will Canadians get healthcare?"   Anyone who doesn't like insurance premiums is free not to pay them, at least until the gov't takes over.   Happy New Year
