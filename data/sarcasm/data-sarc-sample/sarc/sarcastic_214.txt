And YET! The good mayor has the time, money, and extra man power to go to other cities and look for crimes?   Heck. I have been to New York, and he has an awful lot of nerve going anywhere else looking for crimes to solve. And what criminal enterprises has the people of his good city people supplied other cities with. I mean besides the crimes his investigators committed. Drugs, thugs, and murderers to name a few.   Bloomberg, stay the heck where you belong!
