you know what..you are right, any unwanted person should be killed. Lets start with nursing homes and then move on to mental health clinics. After that, we should kill all the poor people because they don't really help society that much. OH! and don't forget the handicapped...who would wanna live like that? Kill them...it is merciful...who cares what they want anyway, they don't know what they are saying. Then we will have a wonderful society
