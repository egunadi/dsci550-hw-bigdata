Actually, shootings happen because a person points a firearm at someone and pulls the trigger. This is illegal. You can't make it more illegal than it already is.   Shootings do not happen because of gun happy nuts running around. Nobody has ever been injured anywhere by any gun happy nut running around. Many have been injured by criminals who disobey the law.   As far as puncture wounds, do stabbings count?   Or, as it appears, are you only concerned with those caused by firearms?
