If you are open minded enough to consider an opposing point of view, Maybe one day you and I can debate those claims. But if you are a typical drive by post and run away "choicer?" I wouldn't be interested.   I digress!   The purpose of this thread (as I understand it) was for people to introduce themselves and say a little about their position. The purpose of this thread was not to debate our differences. I'll not respond to any more "baiting" of that sort in this thread. If you have questions about the details of my views, I will gladly answer those. As I may have some questions about yours.
