Oh I'm so sure that's the case. "Well the economy's at the worst I've ever seen and I don't have a job and can't possibly provide a living for my family and we're in danger of losing our house and living on the streets, but I don't think I'll save us all a lot of pain and agony because I don't have a gun meaning that it'll just be too much work to kill ourselves."   Yeah right, like a lack of having a gun would've kept this family from dying in this instance. Your comments cheapen the value of life.
