So if everyone had a sign on them and a water pistol then would you be happier or does everyone need to have a gun? Should everyone who has a gun have a sign as well? Is the deterrent of a gun diminished without the sign?   I'm also not going to address my brother in every single post. He is a shining example of why I don't like guns but that doesn't mean I'm going to talk about him constantly.
