"I believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the TV crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger," another police official said.   How is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?   Besides that little piece about lacking awareness I don't really buy it.   A gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?Serious question, Penfold,   and I will even dispense with the COMRADE,are you a plant just to get people going?or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm?   and if so I apologize.'
