Kudos to your counterpart for nicely wrapping up all the creationist talking points into one nice essay. He did an excellent job of paraphrasing answersingenesis, he even hit all the highlights, right down to the human footprints with dinosaurs.   I dont' even know where to begin. The part on geology and the earth's magnetic field was so idiotic it's hard to fathom that someone actually wrote that as a serious point.   I'm continually astounded by the lengths creationists will go to to try and justify their beliefs.   The only thing more astounding is their conviction in the belief of their own rhetoric.   Waxy
