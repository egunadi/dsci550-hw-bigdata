You mean like allowing for, and funding, comprehensive sex education, birth control, and parenthood planning? Those things alone would reduce the number of abortions significantly.   However, we live in a nation that would fire a Surgeon General for stating that masturbation is healthy. We live in a nation that believes that sex is only of the penis-vaginal penetration variety. We live in a nation where most pregnancy are unplanned. We're so busy "protecting' our children, that we don't realize that the best protection is information.
