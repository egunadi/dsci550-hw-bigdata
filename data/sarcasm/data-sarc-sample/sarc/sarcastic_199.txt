So you deny that this man is a victim? Realize that the gunshot drew attention, and attention is something criminals don't want. Maybe without that gunshot, the guy would've been beaten to death. But I suppose you'd be happier, because at least the old man wasn't a gun owner. Or I suppose you think he should've let the criminal have the money; all that is needed for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.
