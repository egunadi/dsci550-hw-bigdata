So sorry, I was trying to figure out why God lets some women down, and yet favored you. I always assumed it was a mixture of physiology, luck, etc. Sometimes bad things happen, sometimes good things happen. But you claimed God was the one who saw you through and made sure your daughter was born healthy and functional...So, again, in a similar situation (trust in God, doctors say baby will be born damaged, etc), if it turns out the doctors were right, is God to blame for letting me down? Or was it, in fact, just the way things are sometimes?   Or does God just randomly hear some prayers, but not others? No, no...lemme guess. "God has a plan for us all"?
