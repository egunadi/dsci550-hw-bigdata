By far most speech about homosexuality from those who don't approve is not hate speech. You've been listening to too much propaganda from gay lobby groups who think demonizing and working toward persecuting Christians for their beliefs is the best means to an end. If Canada limited it's persecution only to those who are trying to change the law, there wouldn't be a problem.
