So when somebody with bad intentions breaks and crawls in through a window, and shuts off your power so you can't use the telephone, and comes busting through your basement door, shooting them is vigilante justice? To you this situation doesn't qualify as self-defense?   I highly doubt the woman is lying about the entire matter, because if she was the prosecuting attorney and the police wouldn't be so willing to not press charges against her.
