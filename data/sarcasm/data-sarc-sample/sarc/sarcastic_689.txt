Do you have a fire extinguisher in your house? I have never had a fire in my kitchen but I still keep a fire extinguisher in there. I look at wearing firearms for self defense the same way I look at wearing a seat belt. I wear it and pray I'll never need it, but I'll be damn glad I'm wearing it if I do need it.   God Bless
