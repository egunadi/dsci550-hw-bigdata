Why do 14 bus loads, 500 SCIU members, need 2 Police squad cars from DC to protect them from 1 Home owner?   Fishy? I don't think so! I think the COPS were there to Intimidate the one home owner, just like SEIU was there to do! Cops! Of all things, they used Washington DC COPS! Cops!   No? What am I missing?   Makes one wonder if things got out of hand and the protesters started throwing rocks through the window, and if the terrified home owner would have stepped out with a fire arm, am I wrong to think that the DC police would have shot the home owner? Seriously What the heck gives? Cops! Part of the angry mob?   If nothing else, 500 people trashed this guys lawn! That is for sure.   Am I missing something here, or am I correct to think that we have totally degenerated into Chicago style intimidation politics? See the video for reasons why I believe this.
