But I suppose the Pope is going to hell   Here is a link to a website that has a brief list of translational fossils, there are gaps but that could mean that we have yet to find those fossils, or we have found them but no one has made the link yet.   You also keep stating that evolution is theory, we all agree it is still a theory but it is the most plausible theory that fits the evidence found that Evolution is the most likely mechanism to explain that we have lots of different species, to condense it to the real basics just think of it as the ancestry of the species.(Apologies for condensing the Theory into those small sentences could be here forever explaining Evolution )   N.B Evolution does not mention how life started, there is another Scientific Theory on the Origin of life on Earth, but I can not think of it at this moment.   Hunter it is really not good form on a message board when debating a subject to say someone is going to hell because they don't agree with your viewpoint, present your evidence why you believe that evolution is incorrect and we can have a proper debate.
