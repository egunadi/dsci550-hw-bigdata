oh please dont give me that XXXX... its so great that you can try to turn that whole statement and point at me being at fault but that in and of itself shows you are at fault because you think that without your way the world would cease. Honestly, the world has lived without gay marriage its whole existence.... so why implement it now?? SHouldnt that say something about the human race when it steeps so low to want to call homosexuals married couples?
