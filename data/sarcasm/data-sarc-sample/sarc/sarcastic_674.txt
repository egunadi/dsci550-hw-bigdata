Oh look, a lie. Imagine my surprise.   Truth: Scientists have extrapolated that the universe expanded from an incredibly dense mass. The Big Bang theory does not posit that this mass "popped" into existence; in fact, we have no idea what happened less than 10^-43 seconds after expansion began. It is a common interpretation that there was no time "before" the mass existed, therefore the first law of thermodynamics was not violated.
