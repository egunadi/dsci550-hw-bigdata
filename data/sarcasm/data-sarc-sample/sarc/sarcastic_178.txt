Except that that would be the author's words, not a direct quote. Notice the absence of quotation marks? Special Agent Newell never said "17% came from the US". The author has as much trouble with the stats as you. 17% of the total have been traced to the US. We don't know the percentage of the total that did indeed come from the US but is untraced or untraceable. See the difference?
