I think that Comrade Brian is pulling our collective legs by pretending to be a die-hard, uninformed, living-in-denial communist, when in fact he's a just another guy trying to have a laugh by trolling the boards.   I truly find it hard to believe that anyone could be so completely uninformed about capitalism and socialism.
