So lets ban cars... They kill people... And think all the money could go to public transportation. Also we should ban baseball bats as thats the obvious next step in weaponry... Don't forget archery... Can't have the subjects have any of that...   Since we are taking away all these weapons to coddle the masses, Will the government be disarming too?   I see a need for both kinds of weapons as a freeman.
