FDR saved this country? If I recall, it was in 1933 that, because of a combination of weakened capital situations from Reconstruction Finance Corporation loans which published lists of the loan takers, and a nation-wide banking holiday, banks around the country went through a new wave of demise, dropping the D/C and D/R ratios so sharply that, in one month alone, the money stock (M2) fell a whopping 4 1/2%.   Wasnt it under FDR that the NIRA codes, and, after 1935, the NLRA, enacted minimum wages, driving up nominal wages and thus unemployment?   Wasnt it during FDR administration that the reserve ratio was *doubled*, sending us back into another recession starting 1937?   The only thing FDR "saved" was the depression for a couple more years.   -GFA
