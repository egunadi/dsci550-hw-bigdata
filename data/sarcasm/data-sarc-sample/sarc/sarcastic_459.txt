Your use of language is rather colourful here (lying propagandist!) and smacks of hyperbole. What is being critisised here is bad application of the scientific method in relation to National Geographic's articles on the nature of relationship between birds and dinosaurs. I think Olsen makes some very pertinent points, but at no stage is he saying that evolution does not occur or the possibility that there is no link between any theropods and birds ever.   What he correctly draws attention to is poor peer review and less than conclusive evidence to support the hypothesis of the article's author. In turn this is a stinging criticism of the NG given its high profile, reputation and claim to being a leading forum for the presentation of science in a popular format.
