Shh shhh it's ok mellow mellow mellow. Relax you have managed to go from legalizing gay marriage to a collapse of our legal system and the downfall of man's ability to reason and govern himself in two paragraphs.   Maybe gay people would like to enjoy some of the happiness you get from your marriage and same as you that happiness is worth the oppressiveness incurred as a result.   You may have more in common with gay people than you think.
