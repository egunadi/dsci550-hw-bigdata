So you think that, if murders were legal, there would still be the same number?   How about robberies, or rapes? There are plenty of those, the law can't be having any effect...   In short, I'm saying that making anything illegal reduces that thing. Criminalising murder results in less murder, criminalising drugs leads to reduced supply of drugs (compare any drug with nicotine, or alcohol), and criminalising guns would lead to a similar reduction.
