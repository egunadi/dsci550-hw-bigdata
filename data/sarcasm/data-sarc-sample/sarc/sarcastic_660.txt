Biblical literism is the only way to view the Bible. I could 'metaphorically' say that Dawkins really believes in God in his own way, because he said that ID is possible for this planet because aliens may have seeded the first self replicating molecule here Millions of years ago.   That is silliness or even foolishness. Nothing taken literally from the Bible is irrational. God is rational and His creation is rational.   In fact, the "Scientific Method" originated from the idea that the Physical Universe operates on rational physical laws because the Creator did it in logical fashion.   What did we have b4 that? "Dragons eating the moon during an eclipse'? Angry gods causing volcanoes to erupt? Apollo racing his fiery chariot across the sky every day?
