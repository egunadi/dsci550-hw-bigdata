Like, I said, I can't take men's position on abortion seriously b/c they can spout off all they want; however their viewpoint must be affected somewhat by the fact that they will never actually have to make the decision themselves.   As far as circumcision...um...who cares?  J/k. I really don't know what to think about that. Never given it alot of thought, as I've never had a penis, don't plan on growing one, and therefore I can't have a valid point of view. Do whatever feels best to you. Get my drift?   Hey, you two, Clerisian and Steeeve, quit arguing semantics. Geesh!
