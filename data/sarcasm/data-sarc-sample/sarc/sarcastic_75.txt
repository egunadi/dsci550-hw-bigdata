The point is that these laws against cheaply manufactured handguns are no more than economic restrictions on gun ownership. This is similar to old english laws which established actual economic requirements for owning weapons. Gun accidents happening due only to poor construction are rare. This is just another form of people control, keeping weapons out of the hands of the poor so as to lessen their importance in politics. "Screw them, they can't do anything about it."
