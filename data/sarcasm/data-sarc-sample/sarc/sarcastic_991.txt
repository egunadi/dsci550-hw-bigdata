Because it works. How much money is pumped into microchip design and production? IBM engineers must be so corrupt; the temptation to lie about quantum theory so they can pretend to offer faster processors must be overwhelming! And don't get me started on the evolutionary algorithms they use - clear evidence of atheist bias and lying. As if evolution could design better microchips!   Research based on evolutionary theory is well funded because there's massive potential for return on investment. Who funds ICR? If you're so keen to follow the money, at least do it consistently.
