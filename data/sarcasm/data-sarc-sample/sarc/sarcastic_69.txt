Not all threads need to be courttroom style debates. If you choose to aid in establishing a working consensus fine. If you want simply to rave and rant there are plenty of venues where you can do that. Your participation is welcome as long as you are a participant and are seriously trying to resolve the issue. Otherwise for heavens sake go do something else.
