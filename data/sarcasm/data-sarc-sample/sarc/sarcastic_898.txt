Some interesting information, that website where you got your link from, "Reasons To Believe" (RTB) is not a creationist organisation. It is run by compromising Christians, such as Dr Hugh Ross. Answers in Genesis have got quite a lot of information on him and as a result have even more rebuttals to his arguments. Here are several links:   http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/4149.asp   http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/4128.asp   I did notice, however, that the RIB article was written in the year 1999. This is most pecular, because the AiG article in which Dr Russell Humphreys defends himself is written in the year 2000. The following link is a very brief summary of how Dr Humphreys defended himself and his new Relativistic Cosmology from compromising Christians and evolutionists:   http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs...10-10-2000.asp   The following link is where Dr Russell Humphreys defends himself. It shows both the arguments and his rebuttals:   http://www.trueorigin.org/ca_rh_03.asp   I would strongly suggest that you read it.   I can definitely see how you may doubt Dr Humphreys new Cosmology, that was a pretty heavy attack, the much of it went zip, right over my head. But I just can't help but feel that they mis-interpreted several lines and are using some straw man attacks. I personally cannot see anything wrong with his arguments, although if there is, he has given way for a new area of cosmology, a Creationist Cosmology.   I hope that this helps clear up this little problem regarding "Starlight and Time". Got to go,   Matt.
