Sure let me have your sermon/propaganda of misinformation since it doesn't match the context of the Scriptures.   propaganda   n : information that is spread for the purpose of promoting some cause.   mis·in·form  Pronunciation Key (msn-fÃ´rm)   tr.v. mis·in·formed, mis·in·form·ing, mis·in·forms   To provide with incorrect information.   con·text Pronunciation Key (kntkst) n.   1. The part of a text or statement that surrounds a particular word or passage and determines its meaning.   2. The circumstances in which an event occurs; a setting.   And since your "experience" does not guarantee you to be an expert I will stick to the context which matches what I have said.   Job 32: 4 And Elihu had waited for Job with words, because they were older than he in days. 5 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, then his anger burned. 6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and you are very aged; so I held back and was afraid to make my knowledge known to you. 7 I said, Days will speak, and many years will make wisdom known. 8 But it is a spirit in man giving them perception, even the breath of the Almighty. 9 It is not the great that are wise, nor the aged who perceive justice; 10 so then I say, Listen to me; I will declare my knowledge, I also.
