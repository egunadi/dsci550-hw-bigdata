You know what? You're starting to remind me an awful lot of reverend Jackson and reverend Phlaeger (the one who said they were going to kill anyone that didn't support their ideas of gun control). The claimed that a gun shop owner was intentionally violating the laws of Chicago and selling all kinds of weapons to gang members, simply by being one mile outside of the Chicago city limits.   Your entire argument is that since there are firearms dealers within a certain distance to the Mexico/America border, then they must obviously be outfitting the mexican drug cartels.   You've hung yourself with this article you just posted, and I'm gonna explain why. The ATF has said there are 6,700 licensed dealers along the border, meaning they know exactly where they are. So why exactly isn't the ATF going in there and breaking them up for their illegal activities? After all if close proximity is an unquestionable sign of guilt, then the ATF must know that these guys are equipping mexican drug cartels with fully automatic machine guns (the kinds that the American people can't ever get) and grenades and rocket launchers, and maybe even the odd nuclear warhead.   The ATF shut down Red's Trading Shop on matters as insignificant as typos. So why aren't they going in and shutting down these rogue dealers if they're doing anything wrong? It's illegal to own an automatic weapon of any sort without a federal tax stamp, and it's not possible for civilians to own post-'86 model automatic weapons, so why isn't the ATF doing something about it if they're breaking the laws?   Seriously Aussie, what is it, is the ATF saying "We know they're breaking the laws, but they're not doing anything illegal we can bust them on"?
