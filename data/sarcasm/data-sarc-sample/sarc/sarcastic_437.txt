But what if it is unconstitutional, like Prop. 8?   No, it doesn't.   Are you saying homosexuals aren't American? Are you saying that more of gay's right should be stripped, including that of protest? How dare them fight for their own freedoms? I should lend you my time machine, and you should go tell this to Malcom X.   And you still haven't responded to my post.
