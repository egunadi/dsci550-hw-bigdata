So, which is it? You don't want violators of Federal law to have guns, yet you don't want them to get rid of them either. Can't possibly do both, now can you? Which one? Do the law breakers keep them, or not? Make it against the law to keep the guns...now make it against the law to sell them. DUH! I guess we'll just hang out in limbo-land!
