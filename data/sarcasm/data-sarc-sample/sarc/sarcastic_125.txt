You need to learn what a metaphor is, if english is your first language you must have been dropped out of school as a baby.   When the researchers say plants "know" they are near their genetic cousins, they don't mean they have a conscious awareness of it and deliberately alter their growth patterns. That is, it is a specific physical response to a specific physical stimuli, and the plants could be made to do the same thing by the presentation of the same stimulus in the absence of any other plants.   Of course, you aren't interested in testing things, because that would be too materialist for you. You just prefer to skim articles and fail to understand metaphors, that's true "psychical science".
