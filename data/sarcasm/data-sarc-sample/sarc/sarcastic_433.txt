Oh, it certainly is an issue. Martin Killias, a Swiss criminologist, did find a link between gun ownership and homicide in Switzerland. However, my point was to ask you if you would be willing to abide by such regulations. The law in Switzerland requires that military weapons kept in the home be unloaded and stored under lock and key.   I don't think Switzerland is a gun-nut utopia.
