So reading and literature aren't to be taught?   I love it. More stupid, paranoid parents for me to mock mock mock. They are sooo part of a great big problem. A problem that sees my kid getting threatened and bullied - so I feel totally justified in my mocking. Frankly, there are days I would like to kick them in the teeth.
