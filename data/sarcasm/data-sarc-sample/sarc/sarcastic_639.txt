*walks in*   *looks at posters*   *notes no fundies have spoken out yet*   Well, it's OBVIOUS that you don't have a discerning spirit and are thinking with your carnal mind. If you'd only have accepted the truth of the undying and never changing word of God, then you'd understand.   You just gottsta believe first.   It's as simple as that.   But, no, you go right on hating God and you'll soon see where that will get you.   BURNING IN HELL!!!   Hahahah, FOOL!   You are soo going to roast. In pain. FOR EVER!   But, that's not my words.   That's Gods!   Me?   I love you.   I love you long time.   Like forever even.   If only you'd accept Jesus into your heart.   Cause if you did.   You'd see no contradictions in what you posted.   Seriously...   Drink the flavoraid.   edit:   Capitalize, size increase, italicize and underline various parts of my post.
