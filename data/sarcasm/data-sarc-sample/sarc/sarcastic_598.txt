Wow! You really have been paying attention to the Democratic smear campaign of the healthcare insurance industry, haven&#8217;t you? Did you also pay attention to their relative profit margins VS those of other industries? It was 2.2% ROI!!! Banks make 10X that much and I don&#8217;t hear your demagoguery directed at them. In fact over 35 other industries make higher profits than health insurance companies.   Try doing some of your own research for a change and stop listening to DNC brainwashing. If they spent Â½ of the time that they spend railing against the current healthcare insurance companies on something more pertinent, like shutting off the unlimited money supply to banks, this country would be able to pay for our, and probably Canada&#8217;s, healthcare.
