That money will never be paid. "Doctor" Hovind (his doctorate is from an unaccredited diploma mill) has phrased his offer in such a way that it is impossible to get it.   Numbers 1-4 have absolutely nothing to do with evolution, but gullable people fall for it. Number 1 is actually impossible to prove.   Hovind probably doesn't even have $250,000. In 1996 he declared bankruptcy, and there's no reason to believe that his financial situation has suddenly improved. He claims that "a wealthy friend", whom he refuses to name, has the money. The committee that is supposed to evaluate claims is similarly anonymous, but he has hinted that it's filled exclusively with creationists, who are certainly not unbiased.   Read about Kent Hovind. He really is a worthless piece of scum.
