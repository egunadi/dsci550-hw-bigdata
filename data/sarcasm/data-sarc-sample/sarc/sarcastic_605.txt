So now you are saying that the earth doesn't move? I get it. The earth used to be fixed at the center of the universe when those Bible verses were written but God changed it. Now it orbits the sun like the other planets.   Actually, the verse does say that grasshoppers have four legs. There is no mention of jumping legs. You supplied that because it is foolish to claim otherwise. That's what I mean when I say that you reject parts of the Bible that you see as foolish. When you have accepted the evidence that the Bible is in error (4 legs on a grasshopper, sun at center of solar system, rabbits chewing cud, an unmoving earth) you add elements that aren't in the Bible and declare it without error.   You "interpret" and then claim that you are reading it literally. Pick one and go with it. You seem to claim that you accept the Bible literally and then add whatever you feel is necessary to make it rational.
