Well Spam&amp;Scram is certainly the strangest of the anti-evolution crowd I've come across. He even proclaims that animals change as fact, not something that Creationists concede lightly.   He claims to know very little then decides he knows it all... (OK that's more like a Creationist.)   It might be intresting to see what happens if he came into contact with Creationists.
