How strange. It seems that Habbit's definition of the word definition is meaningless. Physicists and chemists can define what they mean by the word "carbon," but according to Habbit that is just their opinion. According to Habbit, carbon can be a chocolate candy meant to be eaten in a car. That may be his opinion and he considers it as valid as specific definitions assigned to words used by experts in any given field.
