So, we on this board aren't receptive to your proselytizing? Sorry about that. This particular forum is intended to be a scientific discussion, based on logic and evidence. We certainly don't want to waste your time. The door is over there. I find your dismissive, superior attitude to be offensive, to be honest., so I can't say I'll miss you.   But should you ever want to discuss evolution and creation in terms of actual science you will be welcome to return.
