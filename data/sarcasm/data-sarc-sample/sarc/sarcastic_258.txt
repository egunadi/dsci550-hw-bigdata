Yes, and since some might not, it should not be mentioned at all?   Personally I only know a half dozen people who have had abortions (at least that I know if). 1 of them doesn't care, she has had 6 or 8 abortions...pretty much used them instead of the pill. 2 are pro life zealots now and feel terrible about the fact they had aboortions. 2 are pro life, but not zealots. The final one was overwhelming pro choice prior to her abortion. Attended rallies and everything. SHE felt so bad about havinghte abortion afterwards that 6 months later she blew her head off. She could not get it out of her head that she had killed a baby. She became totally obsessed and finally cracked.   So, yea...maybe it is not so out of line for people, including men, to say "Think about it real hard because a lot of people regret it". You don't have to get shot to know it hurts.
