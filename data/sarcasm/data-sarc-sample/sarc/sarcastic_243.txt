So the police can be there instantly if you have an intruder? They can respond before you even call them? Wow, you have some fast-responding police! That's fine if that's what you want. But I'd prefer take personal responsibility for myself and my family, thank you, rather than trust the police who may or may not be reliable, trustworthy, and likely won't be there fast enough to stop an attack before it happens.
