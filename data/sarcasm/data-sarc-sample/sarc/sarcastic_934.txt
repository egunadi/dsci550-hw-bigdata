I see. So what you are saying is that you are unsure about evolution and wish to explore it. Great. Then start with one of those unreasonable and dumb arguments and present it. Why are you more reasonable and not so dumb?   It's easy to do what you have done. I can claim that invisible pink unicorns push the moon across the sky. I can claim that you are unreasonable and dumb because you disagree with me. But it is meaningless unless I am willing to show that I have a pair and can step up and show why I am right.   Do you have a pair?
