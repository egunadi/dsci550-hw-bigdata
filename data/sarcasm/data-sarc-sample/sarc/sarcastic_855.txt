Well, actually, I did find it funny even though I'm a male (or at least, I think I am?)...probably because it's a joke and I know I'm not like the stereo-typical male so I can laugh at them.   PS, I'm so unique because I'm so humble and would never brag about my bulging muscles, manhood and amazing intellect.
