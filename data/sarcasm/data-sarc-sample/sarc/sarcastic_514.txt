That's the trick, isn't it? If its a threat. But since when is a fetus a threat? Sure, when the fetus is endangering the mother's life, fine. But 97% of the time, it's not.   Can a woman kill using her own body? Steal? Rape? No, of course not. I can't rape anyone and get away with it because I used my own body. Next time you get caught stealing, tell the judge that you were using your own body to do it, and you can do whatever you want with your own body. Enjoy the following laugh.   And prove to me that a fetus is not a living human. In fact, find ANYTHING that is made of cells and is or was not living.
