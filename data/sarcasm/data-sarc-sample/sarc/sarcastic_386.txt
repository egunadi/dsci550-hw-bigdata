On the contrary, the wet dreams of those slavering over these appalling British figures miss the fact that bad as they are, those 3 or 4 more murders in the USA per hundred thousand population equates to your likelihood of being murdered there as at least ten times higher than in that dangerous place Britain. Suck on that.
