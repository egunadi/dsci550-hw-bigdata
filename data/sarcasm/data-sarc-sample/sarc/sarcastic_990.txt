Again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. Whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. It can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. Most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. Science can make no assertion as to what you saw. You may think it is wonderful, but LSD had that effect.   How strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. Actually, it's sad.
