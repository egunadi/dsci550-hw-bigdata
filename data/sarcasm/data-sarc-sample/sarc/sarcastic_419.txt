Yes, because although we trust our military with anti tank missiles, .50 machine guns, artillery, fighter planes, cruise missiles and even nuclear weapons, god knows you wouldn't want them parading around in public with a glock under their jacket unless they have renewed their permit in person.   I would have thought that people would have learned their lesson from the federal assault weapon ban. It was expensive to enforce, a major sore spot for a fairly large percentage of the population, and had no real positive effect, mainly due to the fact that it addressed no identifiable problem.   You expect such things from a liberal stronghold like california, a state with high crime that is always on the verge of bankruptcy, out of control labor costs, where they can't even keep the power on all the time becuase their environmental regulations are so rediculously stringent that the fiscal realities of building new powerplants are soo terrible that nobody would even consider it.   I thought people were more intelligent in your new state, George.
