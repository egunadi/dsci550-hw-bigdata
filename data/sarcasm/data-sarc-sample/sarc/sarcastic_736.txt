Six people out of, at the very least one million, at the very most five million.   Are you really gonna prosecute one million plus people based on the actions of six individuals? Are you expecting a 1,000% perfection standard from gun owners?   How many catholic priests have molested little children? Should we hold them all responsible?   How many gun control supporters also support the killing of unborn children?   Or better yet, how many game animals have died of starvation and disease, because gun control supporters lobbied against hunting seasons?
