How were they able to get an "aggravated assault" charge pinned on you?   I'm assuming she never had a mark on herself to show the cops.   Had you two had a previous domestic call history with the police?   Hopefully justice will be served when you get your day in court.   Then you'll get to experience the wonder that is "family court", if you haven't already.   You have my sympathies.
