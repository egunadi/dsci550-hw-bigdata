Looks like you're not asking for objections to the conclusions and analysis this time around, like you were here. I guess it is wise only to argue on the grounds you know your opponent will find the most irritating or difficult.   At any R.A.T.E. (ha ha ha...), I'll repeat the objections raised on the old forum, which move to doubt the sufficiency of the empirical data:   From http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq...1_1/Helium.htm:   "Thus our new diffusion data support the main hypothesis of the RATE research initiative: that God drastically accelerated the decay rates of long half-life nuclei during the earth's recent past."   The empirical data is missing, Zero. The problem with the empirical data in support of the above statement, is that it does not exist.
