Forgive me for laughing; no, not really ha, ha, ha ha ha   Could it be that people here as well as Canada and the rest of the world has figured out your infantile "grading system of States" is a complete sham and your very reason for existing is but an anti-constitutional farce and has lost any claims you have or will make? You stand alone now brady, with simply a few still clinging to the false hope of having others pay for your failures and unConstitutional stance so you can sit on your hands while you keep harping on overturning the 2A.
