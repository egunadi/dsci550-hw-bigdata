So, you consider a so called theory which allows a 10 billion year gap out of an alleged potential 10 to 20 billion year age for the occurrence to be the most credible theory? And is actually supported by evidence? If they have any evidence, why the 10 billion year gap for wiggle room? No wonder you accept evolution as a rational possibility. The fact is, they have no credible evidence at all as the big bang is nothing more than a deduction based on theoretical mathematical equations which can neither be confirmed or verified.   Just read the link and consider the factors cosmologists must consider before even doing the math required to come up with an age. Now consider how skewed the outcome must be if they are incorrectly interpreting even one aspect of the info they are relying on for the equations which result in an age.   Any errors in those results and the out equations are useless. Thus, the 10 billion year gap in their cosmological guessing game.   How Old is the Universe?   Now consider the creator of the big bang theory itself. Edwin Hubble proposed the big bang as a possible beginning of the Universe based on the perceived expansion of the universe from a tiny central singularity back in 1929. Since then it has become the holy grail of the scientific community in explaining how Time and Space began. http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/bigbang.htm   This theory is made up of nothing more than the imaginings of a young cosmologist back in 1929 yet has been adopted as a rational theory by the scientific community as if they are a bunch of lemmings who will grasp at any explanation which doesn't claim that God did it.
