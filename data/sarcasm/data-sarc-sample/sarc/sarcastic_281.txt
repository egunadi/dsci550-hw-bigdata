So what? A person has a right to defend themselves, as spelled out in the Constitution.   Or would you rather the 80 year old just get beaten to death for his $262?   Or maybe you'd feel better if he'd suffered the same fate as the home invader over in Maryland. He made the mistake of breaking and entering into a student house and was slaughtered with a sword.   And what point are you trying to make anyway? It's not like the 80 year old went on a killing spree of anything. Nobody got murdered. So what're you moaning about?
