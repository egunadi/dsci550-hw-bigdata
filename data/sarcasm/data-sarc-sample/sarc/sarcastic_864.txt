And you don't actually see the circulariey in your position? The Bible is inspired by god because the Bible says that it is inspired by god. What if I wrote a book in which I declared that the book was inspired by god? Good for you? I'll do it if you give me the word.   And what about the Book of Mormon? Takes your book and goes one better. Also inspired by god because it says that it is inspired by god.
