I'm not going to go into what is wrong with the idea of God without knowing it is what we mean we speak the word.   Excuse me if I am mistaken, but it seems that you are getting defensive on your belief before I even begin a debate. I'm simply looking for any one wishing to participate on the nature / existance of God.   If you find my questions to be complete nonsense and that I'm only here to critize theism than you need not participate.   thebootfitter,
