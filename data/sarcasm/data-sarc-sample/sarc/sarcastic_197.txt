BECAUSE I SAID SO!   LOL,... I'm so silly.   I just had to post it.   Seriously, I decided that I will actually construct my summary online, Iangb.   If you (or anyone else) cares to, you will be able to watch as I edit and construct my argument. It may be lengthy so keep it in mind that if I have to divide it up, and you post in the interim, I will have to delete this first half and move it to the end.   By the way,... other than working some things out in my head,... I don't have anything prepared to post. This will be a work in progress.   ... this will take quite a while. (Maybe days)   I see you are watching, and don't want you thinking this will be developing quickly.   I will let you know when I've concluded.   --Chuz   *** Note to Ian. In my attempt to compile my 'summary' I have realized that I never actually completed my arguments. It's kind of hard to summarize that which hasn't already been presented. So, my sumarization if you will- will now consists of two parts. First my arguments and then my summary.
