Bingo. Old fossils can be corrupted (contaminated, to be precise) by contacting anything from human skin to pollen in the air. This would add a relatively large amount of carbon to the fossil and would indicate that the fossil is recent.   It's not hard to imagine this happening in the hands of inexperienced scientists... *cough* Creationists *cough*
