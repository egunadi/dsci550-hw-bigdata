Such black and white thinking places the Supreme Court and the NRA at one time in the category of gun banners. The Supreme Court stated that only firearms in common use receive Second Amendment protection. The NRA once supported a ban on Saturday Night Specials:   "Viewed realistically, junky .22 handguns that retail for as little as $7.98 . . . aren't suited for target shooting, handgun hunting, or police or protection purposes. Most honest-to-goodness gun owners wouldn't have one around. Yet the reckless use of such junk has harmed legitimate firearms ownership."   -"Restraint on TV, Cheap Handguns Wins Favor," American Rifleman, (March 1968)   "On the Saturday Night Special, we are for it [banning] 100 percent. We would like to get rid of these guns."36   -NRA Executive Vice President Maxwell Rich, Senate Hearings on Saturday Night Special Ban, (September 13, 1971)
