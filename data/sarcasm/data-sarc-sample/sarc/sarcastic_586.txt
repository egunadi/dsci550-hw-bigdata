And here ladies and gentlemen we have the evidence of why I am justified in calling the likes of "stormboy" an XXXXX. The guy tries to discuss science when he is so utterly lacking in basic science that he thinks that the earth spins to "keep[s] the oceans from falling off towards the sun"...   stormboy, there is a thing called gravity: it is what "keep[s] the oceans from falling off towards the sun".   Now please go away and get an education, then when you have even the faintest idea of what you are talking about (which you currently do not), come back and attempt to debate. It will be for your own good as you are just making yourself look a prat by staying here.
