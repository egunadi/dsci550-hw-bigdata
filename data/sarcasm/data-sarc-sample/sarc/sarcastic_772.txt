Oh yeah, like that hasn't been tried before /sarcasm It darn sure isn't about crime control. No doubt some nefarious excuse to farther control the people and attempt to charge user fees to discourage a right. No doubt sinjin will approve so "they" can match fingerprints and type of ammo to the DROS registration file?   The early birds get the worm After June, the best spots may already be taken and kalifornia laws will be shot down and they will be left with just what they claimed to want...nothing economical, an end to registration, people carrying loaded guns and buying cases of ammo out of State (no tax) while crying wa wa wa wa wa!   Don't forget Jerry Brown will probably have some changes of his own. Seems he is more pro rights and 2A than 'da terminator'.
