I know! How dare they just not sit back and accept the discrimination they so rightly deserve. It's just incredible the amount physical and emotional damage you would undergo if these people are given the same kind of respect you are. We can't have that! This may be a a government for the people, and I am sorry but you are only part of the people and to be granted the respect of people if you screw and love the people that the majority say you have to screw and love. God bless er Buddha bless er Mohammed bless...er Rhiannon bless America!
