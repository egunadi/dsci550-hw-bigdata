So all jellyfish die on the beach?   Hardly.   Let's use this same type of logic though.   A jellyfish is pretty fragile, as you pointed out.   Wouldn't a jellyfish that was very rapidly covered in sediment be broken into many pieces, if not ground to a paste?   Wouldn't this entirely rule out the possibilty of preservation in this manner?
