So, whether the embryo/fetus/whatever-you-want-to-call-it has rights seems to be a non-issue. Because, for pro-choice folk, even if it has rights, it still is preferable to ensure that it can be legally killed.   Of course, it is obvious to everyone that an entity does not need rights in order to have legal protections. But I'll let that slide for now.
