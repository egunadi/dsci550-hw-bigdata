So you plan to move out of N.Y.in a year or two,and own a gun?why not now?N.Y.laws are sticker than most,but not all.You want to teach your kids to shoot?Better do it now,later on it will probably be harder.   Well if you don't think that gun control is the most important issue in the world and you totally agree that people should be able to own guns,but yet you have no problems with states making it mandatory for gun owners to have permits,thats almost a contradiction of terms for someone that says their pro gun.   I may be wrong but is anyone saying or implying total gun freedom?   What we are saying is, to many laws on it no more.   35-40 years ago we didn't have all this B.S.about it,you wanted a gun you went and got one (in other words very readily available)   Walk down the street with one and you didn't have a S.W.A.T.team on you.   We have seen to many gun rights taken so yeah every time a new policy or   amendment comes along we are antsy about it.   So if you support every amendment made to the constitution pertaining to guns, than I submit your not to interested in owning a gun.   And for the record:gun toting bandits(out here we say bandito's)are jumping   out of every ally{figuratively speaking}.But the pro-gunners know that if the   anti-gunners had their way,only the bandito's have guns.
