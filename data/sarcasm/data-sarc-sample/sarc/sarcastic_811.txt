Well, I think it is best to use a real source. Like the Australian FBI, called the A.I.C..   The latest figures. Violent crimes from 1996 to 2007 (per 100,000 persons per year)   Homicide is pretty much a flat line no? However there violent crime is not. And to be fair, Australia's murder rate has always been significantly lower then ours and they should be congratulated for there socialization for it too.   So if gun related crime goes down but the murder rate remains relatively flat, but other violent crimes go up, then what is thew point of mentioning that GUN Related crime went down?
