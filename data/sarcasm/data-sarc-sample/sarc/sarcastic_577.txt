**   The "methodology" of science is not materialism/mechanism/darwinism, but simply empiricism leading inductively/abductively to hypotheses regarding regularities in causation in nature that can be tested via the predictive experimentation of the scientific method. Neither empiricism or the epistemological process of the scientific method are the exclusive property of materialism/mechanism, nor did they originate from within that metaphysic, despite the beliefs of materialist/mechanists to that effect.   Unfortunately, some 150 years ago, that methodology was set aside, and has remained out of sight, with regard to the hypothesis that is generally referred to as 'darwinism'.
