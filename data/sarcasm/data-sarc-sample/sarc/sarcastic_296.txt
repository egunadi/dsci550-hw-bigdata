Oh, good, I get to do this again! They're not Christians, just like Judge Jones isn't a Lutheran. (Your foot should still be in your mouth over that one, but you never learn.) They're all phonies, aren't they, marc? Lucky for marc, he can accurately assess people's belief systems without knowing the slightest thing about their beliefs. But I have this "power," too:marc is an atheist. Sure, he says all this fundie Christian stuff, but he's really an atheist. I know it in my heart because my own belief system, infallible and based upon the teachings of God himself, tells me so. I know, because I know Christians, and marc's not a Christian. He's just a big phony.   And there you go... atheist. Clearly, I've correctly labeled you, and you are nothing but a false teacher.Pathetic, marc. Absolutely, positively pathetic.
