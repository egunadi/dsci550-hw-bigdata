This is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition... yet... but a number of major on-line ones demonstrably do, and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects.   (By the way, the above entries also include the typical "husband and wife" kind of arrangement as well. Funny how words can have more than one meaning, isn't it?)
