Did I claim you did start the thread? Vitroilic hatred, nope pity is the word you are needing there. No I merely pointed out your style of debate. Which I noticed you made no attempt to say it was wrong. Hence guilty as charged simone.   Yep that would be the left's method for free speech. Speech you don't want to hear is banned. On the flip side any conservative speech needs a liberal counterpoint. Am I right simone baby?
