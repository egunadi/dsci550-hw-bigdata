What in the name of heaven is "passive particulate selection" is that found in quantitative genetics in some obscure corner - I challenge you to produce a reference to the term in the open literature. And Mendel's theory was itself (if anything is) particulate in nature and it was NOT derived from Darwin at all. It preceded Darwin and later of course DID serve as a plug in addition to supplant Darwins own inadequate theory of inheritance. And of course Mendel is long ago supplanted by much more detailed and modern genetic knowledge.   As to "dynamic sytemic adaptation" I also suggest you need to document where that term originates from other than yourself. Just what does that mean which is NOT covered by the vary-select-inherit process? Please tell us oh mighty lagomorph how antibiotic resistance arises by "dynamic systemic adaptation" instead of plain old VSI processes and how you distinguish the two.
