You know what is absolutely incredible about you little child? You constantly make the most blatantly ignorant and irrational statements which have no basis at all in reality, yet you actually think you are being intelligent. (Note childs quote in my siggy, below.) And you really should look up definitions before using words when you have no idea what they mean. Didn't you start a thread about that, hypocrite?   You are talking to a person who accepts Intelligent Design as a rational explanation for Mans origin, yet you are so ill informed that you allege he is aligned with a belief in animism, when animism was founded in pagan religions and asserts that pretty much everything has a soul and spirit.   Animism (from Latin anima (soul, life)[1][2]) commonly refers to a religious belief that souls or spirits exist in animals, plants and other entities, in addition to humans.[3] Animism may also attribute souls to natural phenomena, geographic features, and even manufactured objects. Religions which emphasize animism in this sense include Shinto, Hinduism and pagan faiths such as folk religions and Neopaganism.Animism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Now show me a christian who defends ID, believes that, you mental midget.
