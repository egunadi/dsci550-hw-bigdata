Well what do you expect?! Everytime gun owners try and do anything to combat crime, you liberal sissies yell and scream about vigilantism and foam at the mouth as you talk about how we're taking the law into our own hands and that we'll be administering death sentences without trials for matters as trivial as jaywalking!   You want us to combat crime, but you don't want us to actually do anything. Make up your mind already!
