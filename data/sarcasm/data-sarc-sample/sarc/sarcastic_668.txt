Blah, blah, blah.   Stop throwing out discredited and biased stories. Explain in your own terms, exactly how having a gun makes you more likely to be shot. Explain the mechanics of how this works. Go on and try, make some sense rather than cherry picking poorly executed "studies" that prove nothing.   You made the claim that if you have a gun in your possession, this fact magnifies your chances of somehow being shot. What you suggest can only happen if magic somehow exists, like the legally-owned guns sends out powerful magnetic waves to attract the criminals and hypnotizes them to shoot in a situation that they normally wouldn't shoot.
