Except that it does nothing of the sort... But then, what can we expect from somebody citing a website trying to sell you liquid vitamin supplement...   Nevertheless, we look into the Pottenger's cats claim.   Here is a page called, "Lesson of the Pottenger's Cats Experiment: cats are not humans." Although it's a page aimed at explaining why this "experiment" is not applicable to humans, it exposes the other, erm, flaws in this experiment. The one striking me based on the wikipedia list of diets for the groups should be obvious to everyone: many of these cats were being deprived of protein. This page confirms and elaborates. In fact, its first point is that today's cats have no problem reproducing for several generations on today's cooked food. The difference is that good owners don't feed their pets deficient diets.   The real irony here is that this experiment -- were it reliable -- would be the antithesis of supersport's Lamarckism. In order for supersport to be supported, the cats being fed inadequate diets would re-develop those broken pathways for manufacturing essential amino acids. Obviously, they did not. The only thing we see here is the effect of poor (i.e. positively malnutritive) diet.   We can conclude that supersport's Morton's demon is pretty much in full control. There's no other explanation for somebody seeing this experiment and thinking it supports Lamarckism, or even counters evolutionary theory, even if he doesn't know the basics of experimentation and nutrition.
