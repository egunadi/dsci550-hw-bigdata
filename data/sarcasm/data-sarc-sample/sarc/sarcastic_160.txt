Oh really? Gun ownership allowed these "lunatics" as you call them, to become government dictators? If I owned 50 guns and 10,000 rounds of ammunition, you're saying I could run the government with an iron fist all by myself, just like that? Any random person can just appoint themselves God over the entire nation, without a single ounce of resistance just because they're armed?
