Why you quoted me is questionable. What I posted was merely a series of mathematical equations proving that Hovind is completely full of ****. How you consider mathematical equations "mockery" I don't know, but more likely, you did not bother to watch the video. Instead, in your normal fashion, you simply ASSUMED what you wanted to believe and then went from there rather then actually looking at what it was and what it had to say.   Your post more accurately is towards the link that AA posted in defense of his beliefs (yet failed to realize was satirizing those beliefs). Furthermore, I'm not an atheist even though your poor definition wants me to be.
