Wrong again sherlock. All of this animosity is after the fact to why radical islam considers our christian Nation to be hypocritical due to the exporting of our pop culture of hedonistic sexual and moral depravity. That was why they signed fatwas against us originally. It is the abortions, gay marriage and our women walking around half naked that caused that lack of respect to occur. And you can thank the immoral left for that contribution to Americas image. It was the Left that coined the phrase, "If it feels good, do it," Not the Right.
