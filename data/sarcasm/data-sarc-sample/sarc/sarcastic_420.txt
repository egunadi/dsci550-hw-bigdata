Archie, why should anyone even bother with you? You ask someone to explain polystrate fossils-three people do. You plug your ears and go "la-la-la, I can't hear you", then demand that someone explain polystrate fossils. Someone else posts 100 categories of evidence against a global flood, and you wave it away as "evo lies". Yet you demand we take your biased site at face value.   I swear, you get dumber by the minute.
