Well, you ignored the part where I said "voting". But IMO legislative solutions ARE part and parcel to popular appeal because legislators are voted in on that basis. ANY legislator claims to "do what's right." So elections tend to be popularity contests. And legislators tend to want to keep their constituents happy.   Oh and just to make sure you understand this Kronos so as not to get off in the wrong direction, this is my opinion, just like everything else I've said. It is not a lie.
