Well let me say that so far that you haven't been doing a very good job. My arguments are completely solid, and you haven't even gotten close to refuting them. You accuse me of being stupid because my mom watched star trek, you refute my arguments by providing the defonition of masturbation and periods, and then you call me illogical and tell me to think about my statements more deeply.   [quote]You said that you can only abort in the first and second trimester, which I already know. But saying that you don't exsist in these stages is a huge misstatement.[quote]   Let me rephrase that. The beginnings of my body existed. What you know as "me" the person who's saying this, did not exist. My brain, which is really "me" did not exist.
