They only need 1/4 of the legislature, so they'll probably get that. But if it actually gets to the polls? The conservatives took a big hit when they ran around screaming "If gays get married society will collapse and we'll all be doomed!!!11!1!!" and then nothing happened. And of course the most organized group in Mass. opposing gay marriage is the Mass. Catholic church, and people aren't going to take kindly to a bunch of child rapers telling them what's right and wrong. The anti-gay side really doesn't have much to work with; it'll largely be a contest of good will and common sense vs. scare tactics, and the scare tactics have already been proven wrong.
