Oh! mememe! I have an idea!   The museum staff hire (or possibly abduct) a few evolutionists and put them in stocks. The visiting kids then come to the gallery to give Mum and Dad a break for an hour and get to ask the scientists questions about the origin of the earth and why fossils are different from things alive today. Each time an evolutionist gives an answer based on science they get pelted with the leftover veg from the dino pit lunchtime display. This way the kids learn an important lesson in how to deal with scientists as well as being good for the environment by putting all that veg the dinos wouldn't eat to good use! Yay!
