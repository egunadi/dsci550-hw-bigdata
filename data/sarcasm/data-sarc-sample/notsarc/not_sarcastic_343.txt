They do not hate the concept, they merely reject it as being useful or necessary to explain the material universe. I mean come on what utility would a physics which incorporated miracles be? Nothing would be predictable and all utility would be lost. If you want all of science to be arbitrary and unreliable then all ya gotta do is inject miracles into the field.   For example what value is f=ma {except when the diety wills otherwise}.   Or e=mc2 (god willing)
