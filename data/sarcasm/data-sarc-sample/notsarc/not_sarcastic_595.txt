How curious that not everyone can admit that this kind of treatment is wrong. How interesting that another issue comes up instead of addressing the blatant, in-your-face kind of mistreatment of an individual making a private, personal decision.   Like many decisions in life, this is one that is difficult to come to. It doesn't mean it's a wrong one. It's hard because your options are so very serious.
