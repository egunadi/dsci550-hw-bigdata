Well, ya know, if you actually, oh I don't know, VISITED THE SITE, you'd see that the "friendlyatheist.com" is a blog-like page (and not the one that is actually giving the info on the evolutionary migration of humanity) and it gave a link to the actual website that we are talking about (the second link I gave): http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/journey/   But then, maybe we're expecting a little too much from a creationist.
