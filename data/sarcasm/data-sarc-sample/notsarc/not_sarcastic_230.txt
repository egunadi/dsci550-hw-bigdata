I will not give up my right to vote. I will not give up my firearms. I consider people taking my right to firearms as dangers as people trying to take away my right to vote.   In other places around the world, firearms are much more important than the right to vote. There are people around the world trying to get a chance to vote by using firearms to establish a system where they can use the right to vote.   For self-preservation? I will use a bazooka if there is tank comming down the street. The immediate threat I am thinking of is a felon with bare hands on parole. That is exactly what the anti-gunners are trying to limit me from doing. Limit my right to self-preservation from a felon on parole. If you read the other threads, especially from VOR, you will see he is about confiscation not gun regulation. I have asked many anti-gunners about confiscation, when they point to models of UK and Austraila I shudder. Those countries are not about regulation, they are about confiscation.
