But it has never been claimed that everything developet simultaneously. Probably not.   So back to the original question that you ducked with ad hoc arguments. What is Archaeopteryx. If it is a bird, why does it have a tail, grastalia, teeth, pre-orbital fenestra, and on and on. If it isn't a bird then why does it have feathers, opposable hallux, pneumatic bones, a furcula, and even a small carina in one specimen? How can creationism explain Archaeopteryx?   http://home.houston.rr.com/bybayouu/...graphica_1.jpg
