Actually, I think Kronos is right in this case--at least from the standpoint of most consitutional scholars. Of course the framers didn't envision the wording to be used in this way for this purpose--this is what's simply called a "loophole", in this case anyway. It's why there has been an effort in recent years to close the loophole with a constitutional amendment defining marriage.
