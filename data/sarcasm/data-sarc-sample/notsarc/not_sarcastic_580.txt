But...but...   I just swallowed 56 zygotes so that they could vote by proxy through me for the Ripofflican(tm) party this upcoming election so they can win. Now I'm going to have all that indigestion for nothin'.   As to driving...don't care.   What I'll miss most is all of those credit card offers that come in their names. There's just so much that they, living though me want to 'buy now and pay later' on. You saying they can't do that?
