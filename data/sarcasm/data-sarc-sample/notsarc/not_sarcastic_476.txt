Maybe you need to take a hard look at where your rights start infringing on the rights of others. A pretty good case? Dream on. Sure, you have the rigth to take the morning after pill. you do not have the right to force another individual to sell you that pill, any mroe than you have the right to walk into your local ford dealer and demand that they provide your with a chevy. Its just not the way the world works. People can go to another pharmacy or, not. It really does ntoy matter. Retail establichments are able to decide fro themselves what they carry, the governemtn has no place in such decisions. If they decide not to carry the pill, or the pharmacist simply decides they are not going to dispense it, that is their right. It is entirely an issue between employers and their employees and witht he The American Pharmacists Associations policy that allows pharmacists to refuse to fill presciptions on moral grounds, it is hardly an issue there, either.
