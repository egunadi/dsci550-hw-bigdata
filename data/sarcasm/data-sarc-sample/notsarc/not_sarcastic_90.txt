President Obama has correctly characterized the Bill of Rights is a list of negative Rights against government.   The point is, that the only rights that the government, and or any anti-gunner, or department has, is the infringements we grant them through laws etc.   Taking the info in this article at face value. What was a legal practice to do just yesterday landed this guy in a jackpot for not knowing what or how the Govt. is going to interpret the law to mean today. This is a common problem with, and not to directly pick on the ATF, but gun dealers complain about this all the time. EVEN an FBI agent himself cannot predict, nor curry a favorable interpretation.   What kind of country and legal system do we want? Surely you can see that this kind of stuff is not in ANY WAY Shape of Form, fair to do to a Right that our Constitution says is Inalienable. Or to a person who was an impeccable reputation.   Would you like to be treated in this manner?   The article says, what he did is not illegal, but in the hands of someone with an axe to grind, maybe they didn't like him, or maybe the prosecutor is Anti-gun etc, lands this guy in a jackpot!   Now can you see the problem with this?   I know lets apply all of this to computers! We will just make up any law as we go. How'd that be?
