First, are you not forcing your beliefs on me when you lobby for, enact, and support a law that legalizes an act that I see as murder?   Second, forcing someone to believe as I do is in no way the essence of Christianity. God gives choices (which is another debate) to man. We must simply choose right or wrong. Jesus wants us to influence, not force. Jesus said to His followers in Matthew 5:14-16, "You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven." If I truly believe in Jesus as my Lord and Saviour (and I do), then I must follow His command to influence (not force) the whole world. It doesn't do any good to only preach to the preached.
