Again with the common sense, but that is another issue alltogether. You're arguement that the brain is a fundamental unit of life is just plain wrong, considering the majority of all organisms don't have one. Bacteria, Protists, Plants, Fungi, and some animals are all without brains. Brains are required for motion and fast response to immediate changes in environment, for example a falling rock. Brains cluster nerves so that appropriate action can be taken. Some brains are amazingly simple while others like our own are immensly complex.   Your arguements all show a general lack of study in biology and my common sense is appalled by yours. I am reminded of Bill Maher who once said about the intelligent design debate: "Because you don't have to teach both sides of an arguement when one side is retarded."
