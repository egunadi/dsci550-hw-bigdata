You're thinking is right on, sinjin.   Although it's kinda hush-hush, it has been determined (especially in the more charismatic churches) that when one "goes further" in religion the other feels alienated and problems/troubles that probably would have never risen in their relationship oozes out. A new circle of friends emerge which make the one that is &#8220;left behind&#8221; feel closed out and closed off. Arguments then seem to erupt daily and most of it over who is doing the &#8220;right thing&#8221; according to that religion, followed all too often by divorce.
