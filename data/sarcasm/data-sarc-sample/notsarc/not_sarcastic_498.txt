Hold up, your changing your argument. You said "I have never been accosted by an armed assailant. Hence, I see no reason I need to carry a concealed handgun in order to be brave enough to move about my hometown.". This is the reason you gave for not carrying a firearm, I was simply countering that argument because it didn't sound very logical to me, still doesn't.   As to your new statment, I'll need more info. What do your consider an "accidental discharge" of a firearm. I ask because I do not consider someone pulling the trigger to be "accidental" and therefore I consider true accidental discharges to be pretty uncommon.   Yes, for most people I think the chances of being in a car accident are greater then the chances of needing a gun for self defense. But, I'm not sure why that would make a difference. If it was reversed I would still where my seatbelt.   God Bless
