Archie, instead of deciding before hand that I'm wrong, read what I'm saying. What trees were growing during this flood? I'm guessing there were no acorns sprouting into oaks during the flood. Therefore, in this flood sediment, we would find no rooted trees. We would find no burrows, and we would find no tracks.   Now we've seen you can't answer my question. Whether this is because you didn't understand it, or didn't want to consider it, I don't know. But there is no global flood sediment which meets the criteria neccessary to demonstrate a global flood.
