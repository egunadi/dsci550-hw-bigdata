My recollection is similar to yours. I encountered it in an AP biology class in high school, we spent about 1/2 the extra-long class in labs (I think that was the primary difference).   The giraffe example was an "aha" moment for me personally, I suspected life changed, but the specifics I had never thought about.   I recall a disclaimer at the start of the section, but I don't recall the exact wording.   -Mach
