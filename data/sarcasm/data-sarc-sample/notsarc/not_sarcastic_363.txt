Really? Intra-species evolution and inter-species evolution are one and the same?   *edit*   I was reading on micro-evolution in wikipedia, here is what they had to say...is this incorrect?   "Typically, observable instances of evolution are examples of microevolution; for example, bacterial strains that have become resistant to antibiotics. Because microevolution can be observed directly, both pro-evolution and some anti-evolution groups agree that it is a fact of life."
