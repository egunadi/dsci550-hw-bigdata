Actually, most people do not hold the view that existing marriages should be dissolved. In Massachussetts, it's quite a minority view, almost as low as Bush's approval rating.   In any case, that is irrelevant. I was pointing out why someone might reasonably ask the question you consider so inappropriate. What I haven't seen, either from you or from any of the articles, was what the firefighter's answer was or why he refused to answer. From what I can tell from the scant coverage, he avoided answering but had no trouble discussing his political views. Odd, I think.. or just crappy coverage.
