"One day you're going to realize that you're "evangelizing" and "witnessing" have pushed far more people away from religion then has brought them in."   "You're not telling people about God, you're guilting them and putting them down. You're drawing an imaginary line that separates "us" from "them", and you're cutting yourself off from other people. When Jesus "evangelized" (I believe with all my heart he would hate that word), he made honest friends, not with the purpose to "convert" them. He didn't hand them a track and scare them into being a Christian. No wonder people hate Christians, for God's sake I'm starting to hate Christians."   Maybe you should follow your own advice...   jim:   Yes, God loves Saddam but He hates the way he is acting.
