And it's only wishful thinking that they haven't. You are in no better position than I am. You don't know anymore than I do. Science has admitted that antarctica was much warmer several thousand years ago...not only that but the following map shows that the continent was not frozen. And if it was not frozen several hundreds years ago....and it was not frozen 4-5,000 years ago, as it was stated on this next seal link, then it's pretty safe to say that animals and humans could have both been there in recent history (within a few thousand years.) I agree this is no proof that it was attached, however, it is proof that the weather/temperature was DRASTICALLY different on antarctica than science has admitted.....and there's got to be a reason for this drastic change in temperatures.   http://www.world-mysteries.com/sar_1.htm   http://news.nationalgeographic.com/n...ent-seals.html   In an Antarctic "ghost town," freeze-dried whiskers, skin, and bones provide evidence that the South Pole was a much warmer place not too long ago, a new study reveals.   "We thought, This is really strange. If they are elephant seals, what are they doing here?" Hall said.   The discovery, scientists say, is the first hard evidence for a warming period in the region between 2,300 and 1,100 years ago.   An earlier warming period, between 6,000 and 4,000 years ago, has been recognized by other researchers and is believed to have been widespread, at least throughout the Southern Hemisphere. (so widespread that there wasn't snow on the ground and it wasn't frozen over!)
