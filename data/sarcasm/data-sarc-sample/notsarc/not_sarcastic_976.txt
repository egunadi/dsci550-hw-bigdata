Do you mean like Piltdown Man? It was displayed there for 40 years.   "The Eoanthropus dawsoni, or Piltdown Man, was on display at the Natural History Museum in London for 40 years. It was removed when advanced dating techniques not only showed that the bones were only a few hundred years old, but that some of them weren't even human."   http://www.mentalfloss.com/press_oklahoman2.htm   Do you guarantee that all of the other displays at the Museum are true? No, of course not. Many other things there said to be 'true' are only 'true' in a transient sense of the word (that only science seems to use)   http://www.clarku.edu/~piltdown/map_...klywiener.html Suggests that Piltdown Man had good science behind it, at the time.   Never-the-less the Natural History Museum provides many examples of artistic licence, such as the 'human-like' hand given to a restoration of Australopithecus, displayed at the museum.
