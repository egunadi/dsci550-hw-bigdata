I believe that the vast majority of people, if they are well-informed about responsible sexuality, have access to contraception, and are of reasonably sound mind, would much prefer not to experience an abortion and would take precautions to avoid such a possibility.   It is rather tiresome to hear careless and irresponsible talk of whorish women who seek to become pregnant solely so that they may exercise their right to an abortion.   I have never met such a woman. To be sure, there are unbalanced individuals who are riddled with guilt over sexuality and these individuals are incapable of being sexually responsible. I don't associate with such people and since I have never encountered such a person, I must believe that this sort of person comprises a very small minority.   But with the amount of bluster and piffle to the contrary, I must wonder whether or not such blusterers have any connection at all to what really is.
