I'm not sure what the source of the bias would be. Do you mean that it is somehow prejudicial to link ID with creationism, because, somehow ID is scientific while creationism isn't? But that's just not true. In the Dover case the court concluded that ID isn't science any more than creationism is. In fact, it was clearly demonstrated that the motivation for ID is an effort to disguise the fact that it is nothing more than creationism without the mention of god. Basically, if you scratch an IDer, you get a creationist.
