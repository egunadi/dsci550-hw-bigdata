No, hiding as an option has not changed since the days of old, with the slight difference that it used to be easier to get out of range. I'm talking about mace, stun guns, tazers, home security (double glazed windows, rhino locks, burglar alarms, CCTV/fake CCTV, panic rooms) and so on.   Although you are quite right to point out that hiding is an option. Non-confrontation for the win.   Highwaymen? At the time of the Constitution there weren't exactly vast suburbs that could be prowled by thieves looking for an open window. Burglary today is more... casual than it used to be, largely thanks to the wonders of home insurance.   No, unjust laws are still passed. If a group of people decide otherwise they become 'terrorists' and are treated as such. Might may not make right, but it does make legal, and the US government has a lot of might.   If only widespread gun ownership was 'safe'...
