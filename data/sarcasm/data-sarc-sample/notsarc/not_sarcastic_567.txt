Do you want something other than peppered moths, bacteria developing resistance to antibiotics, Darwin's finches, and the other species of the Galapagos?   Maybe biologists are not allowed to do tests on animals that will kill many of them. This reminds me of Kent Hovind's reward for evidence of evolution: impossible to fulfill.
