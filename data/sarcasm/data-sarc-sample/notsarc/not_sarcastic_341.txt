The fear of God? What God? Only yours or any God? How about the fear of something greater than yourself? Would that be progress?   I'm not trying to inform you or anyone else of anything at this time. I posted thread originally to get reactions to it so that I could better judge whether those views were valid or not. As a side affect people may be influenced by the debates that happen here, but I am doing this for myself more than I am for anyone else. So don't think I'm trying to push anyone to believe anything, although I do wish for people to question their own views as a way to best understand what they believe in and why they believe it. Based on the way you posted here, it is my guess you are unwilling to do that in the case presented here.
