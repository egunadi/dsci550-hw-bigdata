Thanks, my friend, as you can see, Jito completely ignored the substance of my argument as it applies to the current american culture, as she responded to how it would apply to her personal life's credo. A more dishonest way of avoiding the meat of my argument couldn't be formed except by a manipulative, insincere and philosophical coward of jitobear's caliber. That's why there's nothing she wrote that's worth responding to. As usual she hasn't actually responded to anything I said. Why must these leftists twist what we say as they ignore the actual substance of it?
