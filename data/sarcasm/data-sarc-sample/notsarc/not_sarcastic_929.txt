Do the words "govt. by the people and for the people" not matter to you at all? Furthermore, to say that the constitution shouldn't be allowed under the vote of the people itself in unconstitutional, since that's the only way the Constitution CAN be amended. (2/3 of states)   A country that uses judges to determine such sweeping things as redefining marriage is a "legistocracy", which we are quickly turning into as a nation. Even though judges are supposed to interpret the constitution, it's still putting the fate of the people in the hands of individuals regarding their laws. This is not very far removed from monarchy. Personally, I think our founding fathers and the Constitutional framers are rolling over in their graves right now.
