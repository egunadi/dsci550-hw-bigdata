Good shooting! Got two illegal alien perps that had been deported for previous felonies and just committed another after illegally entering the country again.   WE NEED MORE JOE HORNS and a heck of a lot less bradies!   Is this the only case you could find of a CCW exercising his rights (you know the law applies to any citizen of Texas don't you and they need not be licensed?) completely justified in the Penal Code of Texas. Self-defense and defense of a third person or property is justified and required by law...IT IS YOUR PUBLIC DUTY.   Job well done Mr. Horn!!   How come you don't post links (deleted by poster)? This is old news, almost 3 years ago to be exact. Did you think it was sensational? LOL
