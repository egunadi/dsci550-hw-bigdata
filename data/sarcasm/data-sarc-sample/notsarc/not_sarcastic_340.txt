You twisted logic strikes again. I realise that if a group of you were to take your guns and rise up against the current administration, you would all be labelled terrorists. This is not evidence that I support the current regime. How you could twist it to seem so is beyond me.   If I were to state that you couldn't take on a fully grown polar bear with just a short pointy stick, would that mean I am supporting the oppressive rule of polar bears? I think you should sit down and carefully think out what you infer from other's arguments before you keep coming out with these ludicrous statements.
