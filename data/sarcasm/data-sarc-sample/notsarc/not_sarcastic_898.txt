So there's no need to be outraged or question a candidate further just on the basis that he represents the lesser-of-two-evils to you? You're using the fact Palin is there to avoid needing to take Biden to task for HIS statements. If, hypothetically speaking, Palin wasn't there at all and Biden had made the statement alone in a stump speech, you would just leave it at that and not take him to task for his position???   Frankly, if he's the candidate you feel best supports gay rights, I would think this statement on his part would be MORE alarming, and all the MORE cause for concern.   So Biden was against gay marriage there too?   If he's against your right to marriage, knowing why might very well give insight into whether he would change on it at some point or actually be anti-gay in OTHER ways too! Frankly, I find this idea of not probing further to at least try to get some insight into motivations on issues to be pretty odd, let alone not criticizing someone for an anti-gay view just because the other candidate is more anti-gay.
