So you're admitting openly that what is a normal occurrence within the human species is offensive to you. That you find repulsive the very intimacy expressed by your own parents that led to your own existence. Do you see how that innate bitterness against the normal and right feelings that have led to the healthy continuation of the human race is ultimately anti-humanity? Why do you hate the normal propagation of our species Matt? Can't you see that if you were given the power to recreate the world in your image, then the world would cease to exist within one generation? No matter how pro-gay you are, how can you be so anti life in good conscience?
