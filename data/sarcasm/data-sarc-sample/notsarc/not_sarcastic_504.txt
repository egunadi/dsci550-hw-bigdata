It is clearly not a strawman argument. I think he doesn't know what "straw man" means and I think he is meaning to say "red herring."   It isn't a red herring either; it's a perfectly logically related question. I would guess he doesn't see that as he neither understands evolution nor bacterial resistance and, thus, the relationship.
