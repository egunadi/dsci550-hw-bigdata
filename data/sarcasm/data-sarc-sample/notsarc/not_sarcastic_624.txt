At 13 - abortion, unless she is uniquely physically advanced. It's incredible how many men are sure being pregnant is no big deal....   Steve - regarding whether she can consent to abortion.   Technically I don't think a minor can consent to either sex or abortion in any state (unless emancipated). I know that is how it is in Minnesota. I am sure the laws vary from state to state.   Medical decisions generally fall to the parents.   I know whether minors should have access to abortion without parental notifications is a controversial issue. On the surface one would think, of course not - but there is concern for those girls who are in abusive situations at home. And as I told VOR, if I had a daughter bound and determined not to tell me, I would rather she have access to safe abortion than resort to something drastic.   A baby pregnant - yikes. Personally I think it's innapropriate and dangerous for a little girl to carry a pregnancy to term. But I would sure love to simply avoid it through better prevention. I do not think an abortion would be anything but scary for her either - but technically, at that age, it would be safer.   Steve - in no way, shape or form is a 13 year old ready for this - not physically, mentally or emotionally - not for pregnancy, and certainly not for parenting. I have a neices that old - good gracious - no way!
