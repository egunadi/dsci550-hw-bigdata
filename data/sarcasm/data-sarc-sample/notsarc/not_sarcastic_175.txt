Sure.   The woman is a person, and individual, sentient human being. She has the same right to control her bodily resources as any other person does. As such, you can no more force her, against her will, to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus, than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will.   Even if somebody is bleeding to death, and your blood can save their life, they still don't have the right to force you to safely give them of your blood.   Each person have that right to control their bodily resources. If you want to force the woman to remain pregnant, you are forcing her to give of her bodily resources against her will. When you don't insist that everybody else be subject to such requirements, then the argument is hypocritical and misogynistic.   And, of course the US Supreme Court agrees with this, thus ruling that per the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, the woman has the right to privacy, to control her onw body.
