You know, I cannot even remember if we covered it in middle school or high school biology. I do remember learning about Mendel and his genetics, but I swear I can't remember if we even mentioned Darwin's name. If we spent any time on it at all, it was very little.   Our biology classes were mostly devoted to taxonomy, anatomy/physiology, and cellular machinery.
