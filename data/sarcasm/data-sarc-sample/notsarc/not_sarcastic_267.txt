Fish to Amphibian supporting evidence frmo here:   Fish/Amphibian   Transition from primitive bony fish to amphibians:   Paleoniscoids again (e.g. Cheirolepis)   Osteolepis -- one of the earliest crossopterygian lobe-finned fishes, still sharing some characters with the lungfish (the other group of lobe-finned fish). Had paired fins with a leg-like arrangement of bones, and had an early-amphibian-like skull and teeth.   Eusthenopteron (and other rhipidistian crossopterygian fish) -- intermediate between early crossopterygian fish and the earliest amphibians. Skull very amphibian-like. Strong amphibian-like backbone. Fins very like early amphibian feet.   Icthyostegids (such as Icthyostega and Icthyostegopsis) -- Terrestrial amphibians with many of Eusthenopteron's fish features (e.g., the fin rays of the tail were retained). Some debate about whether Icthyostega should be considered a fish or an amphibian; it is an excellent transitional fossil.   Labyrinthodonts (e.g., Pholidogaster, Pteroplax) -- still have some icthyostegid features, but have lost many of the fish features (e.g., the fin rays are gone, vertebrae are stronger and interlocking, the nasal passage for air intake is well defined.)   And while nothing is ever proven 100% in science, the link between fish and amphibians is pretty conclusive. Evidence for dino to bird evolution just keeps mounting and at present it is the best supported theory. Just look at the recent discovery of an oviraptorosaurian dinosaur with 2 eggs still in it's body, two very bird like eggs.....See here:   dinoeggs   So once again, while not proven 100%, dino to bird evolution is the best supported theory. Do you have anything that is better supported???
