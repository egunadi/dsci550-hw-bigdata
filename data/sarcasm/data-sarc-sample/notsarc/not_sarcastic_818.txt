And you people whine at me about using personal insults ( )... anyhow, once a fetus is eight months, I believe, they are fully developed and ready for a premature birth. I was born prematurely, so don't tell me it doesn't happen. So if you get an abortion at eight months, you're not killing a fetus, you're killing a baby.
