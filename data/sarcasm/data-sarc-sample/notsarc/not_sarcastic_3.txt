In other words, you think a Supreme Court decision should only shut down the debate if it's a decision you agree with. Roe v. Wade and Heller do share some striking similarities. For example, Scalia stated in Heller:   "Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms."   However, the text of the Constitution has as much to say about such restrictions as it does about abortion. I've heard that Scalia has been criticized for making such a statement because there is no clear historical precedent dating back 200 years of banning felons from owning firearms. So neither the text of the Second Amendment nor tradition justifies such restrictions. It is an example of judicial lawmaking.
