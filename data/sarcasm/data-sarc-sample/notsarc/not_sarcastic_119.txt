It was in the news for a while and I'm pretty sure the inquiry found that it was a terrible misfortune based on miscommunication between the hospital and the parents. There was no selling of stolen dead babies for profit type of business going on with is what Fishx implies with the first post.   Sorry, didn't mean to offend there but I still think its better than another baby has a chance to live than pretty much anything with respect to the desceased. If it happened to me I would have no problem at all about any of my organs being used to save lives, either directly or indirectly through training of more doctors or research. Yet, I still respect your wishes and said before that if this is going to happen it should certainly be cleared with the parents first. You're just going to have to accept my appologies and realise that I have no idea what you went through, having not been there myself.   Being in an abortion forum, and the nature of the first post it seemed very quite possible that Fishx had had an abortion, though regretted it and wanted the remains to bury - this is a very different case than the one you have unfortunately experienced, hence the question.
