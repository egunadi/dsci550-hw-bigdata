So once again you're steering away from the debate? I don't understand why your ignoring the debate and going off in a whole new direction even after making this same mistake in your last post. You're still showing that the Bible has a flaw in it and therefore your making up your own story about what happened. You're also making predictions about the future based on your own interpretation. I'm sure you won't even considered that your wrong about either of these things though I doubt you have any reason to believe in either of them other than you have the idea stuck in your head now.   [quote]The above fully answers the apparent contradiction you and others find in these passages. The reason you may think I may be presenting information contrary to normative Christian teaching is that you have picked a peculiarly thorny passage - something that skeptics of the Bible and enemies of God will almost always do.[\QUOTE]   It only answers the contradiction after you fill in the blanks with your own interpretation and of course your interpretation is based on your personal views and no facts. All the facts that you can work with are in the Bible and as of this moment the Bible seems to have a flaw in it. Your trying to cover this flaw with a story that you made up. I guess in your mind this makes sense but I don't think many Christians would even agree with you much less those of us who look for logic.
