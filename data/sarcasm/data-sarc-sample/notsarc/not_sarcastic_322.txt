I don't understand your question. If law-abiding gun owners were overwhelming those who should not have access to guns, those who use guns unlawfully, I would be very pleased.   But, as far as I can see, the only goal of the gunners is to make sure that everyone has a gun, no matter how insane, no matter how stupid, no matter how incapable they may be to own such easy-to-use instruments of death.
