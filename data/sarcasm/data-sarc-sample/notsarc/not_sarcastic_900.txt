No, it's not an "inability" at all. It's a simple matter of you trying to take what IS a religious issue for many people and divorce it from religion altogether. That's not going to happen for many people.   And BTW, if you are going to refer to people as "Antis", at least be upfront about what you feel they are "anti-" toward. "Anti-gay?" "Anti-gay marriage?" What?   But behind that are deeper, more fundamental issues about what homosexuality IS and the morality of it. To many people who view homoseuxality as immoral, your movement seems to be trying to write immorality into law.
