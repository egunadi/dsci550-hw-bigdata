Actually it couldn't be any worse then it is right now. More people historically have died at the hands of religious wars then non-religion. Religion has been used to push extreme political viewpoints, selfishness, racism, destruction of whole cultures, hatred, and ignorance. Wow that's something for you to be proud of eh grizzly6626? Through religion, televangelists have become pimps where cash is more important than integrity. While I haven't seen any atheists with bombs strapped to themselves, we've all see plenty of religious fools blowing themselves up each and every day. And of course we all know how peaceful and charitable The Spanish Inquisition was. I guess it's true, when it comes to religion IGNORANCE is bliss...   BTW - you forgot to mention that hitler was a devout catholic.   Yeah, like I said before, it couldn't be any worse then it is right now
