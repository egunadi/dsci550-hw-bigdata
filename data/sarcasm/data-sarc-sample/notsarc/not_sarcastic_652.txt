A soul has a consciences, it can be emotionally moved from different states of being. This is how the Bible can say ones soul is moved; saddened; joyous. Etc.   I think therefore I am. Meaning a soul is emotional and so it really has no body. The soul is what we ask the Lord to preserve.   1Peter 1[9] Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.   Hamburger does not have a soul, it is dead meat. People eat brains and all the pieces of an animal. No soul. The soul is consciences. Under some conditions it can return, not after death or before a brain though. We know that to be impossible. Fetuses do not get emotional; there is no mind to speak of. No soul there to trouble.   If you?re on a machine and a doctor determines your brain is dead, the soul is not there. The body could see hell or heaven and there is no emotional effect. No soul for that.   Read the Bible. Don?t listen to fools; you?re a person with a soul. Use it.
