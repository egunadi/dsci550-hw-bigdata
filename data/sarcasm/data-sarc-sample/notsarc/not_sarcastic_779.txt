Doesn't it ever bother you that you have to come up with ridiculous hypothetical sci-fi scenarios to attempt to prove your side?   First of all, do you really think a head on life support is going to "be no different mentally from someone with a body."? I would say that would probably mess with somebody's head a bit.   Secondly, you sound like you believe this person who is a head on life support deserves equal rights. They are just as helpless as a fetus in the womb. Are you saying it's okay to murder people who can't think and talk? Do you believe that thinking and talking is what qualifies a person for rights?
