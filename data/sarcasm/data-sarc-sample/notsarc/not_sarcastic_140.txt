Notice that nowhere here do you address the claims and evidence -- which the movie apparently lacks -- about the assertions of "the expelled." Trying to deflect attention from your inability to respond substantively won't fly with us; these guys are fudging the stories and sharing only selected pieces in a specific attempt to hide what really happened.   For what it's worth, I feel a hell of a lot more vulnerable as an atheist in my profession and location than IDers should feel in research and teaching academia.
