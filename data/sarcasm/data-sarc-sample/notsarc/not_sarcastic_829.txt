Apparently, all them dinosaurs were just too dumb to climb to higher ground or swim (despite the fact that animals are among the first to do so in disasters - example would be the tsunami in Christmas 2004) All of this also avoids the flying reptiles such as the Pteranodons.   Also, apparently humans are unique in that they are the only ones whose corpses bload and float to the water's surface.   What garbage will they come up with next?
