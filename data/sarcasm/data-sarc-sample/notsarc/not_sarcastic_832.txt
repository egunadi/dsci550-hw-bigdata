Why would that even be expected? When you consider that it is important to maintain some sort of consistency in study populations, obvious mutants are excluded from the breeding stock. And yet, there are frequent observed mutations. In fact, my elder son once observed two mutations in a single fly in one of his populations. One fly had no wings and white eyes.
