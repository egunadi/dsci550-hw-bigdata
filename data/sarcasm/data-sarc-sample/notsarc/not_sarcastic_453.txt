Fetal Homocide? Toddler Homicide? A human in different stages of development.....Why/or What is the difference?And if someone wanted this legal( Toddler Homicide) ...I don't see much anybody could do legally to stop it..   When women kill their tots they are locked up/ and branded with a criminal record vs the female who callously kills durning the fetal stage.(Double standard?)   I have a couple friends, who have aborted more than once, because they didn't want to lose their girly figure(trivial). I find it eerie and disturbion.....
