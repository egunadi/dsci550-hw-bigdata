OK try the US Constitution. We are a representative democratic republic not a majority rule nation. Majorities hold certain powers but they are limited. Minorities continue to have rights which may not be infringed by the majority. Amibiguity and sharing of interests in various types of personal and social decisions is a necessary component of this system. We are built on compromise and that has served us well.
