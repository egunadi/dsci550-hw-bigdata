Because guns are the best method available on the market. Settling for second best when you could have the best is just stupid.   Better locks? The best they'll do is slow down the person seeking to harm you, their effectiveness is contingent on the strength of the door they're on.   Alarms? So somebody will know that you're in danger, what then? That won't get the police there any faster than dialing 911.   Non-lethal weapons? Somethings non-lethal is a non-option. Brandishing a can of pepper spray won't cause an attacker to flee for their life, it won't hold them at bay until the police arrive to arrest them, it won't stop a violent individual from across the room, and it sure as hell won't affect somebody that's doped up on narcotics.   And stun guns are more useless than knives, because as I've said before, you need to get right up against your attacker to use them. You have to get within stabbing distance to shock them, do you really want that to be your best option for protecting yourself? The idea is to keep the bad guy away from you, not let them get right next to you.   All of these non-lethal devices, they set up the false notion that the life of a criminal intent on hurting or possibly killing you, is worth more than your own life. That belief is stupid and should be done away with. Ask any woman that's ever been raped if they feel that their attacker deserves to live more than they do.
