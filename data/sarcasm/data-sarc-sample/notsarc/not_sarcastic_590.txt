Assuming this right exists....you could say that you have no right to kill it though, you can only try to starve it.   -You have consented sex and get pregnant. The pregnancy is a direct consequence that was known when having sex.   -You have consented to a stranger coming into your house to eat dinner. The stranger coming in and sitting down and using your plates and eating your food is a direct consequences of you inventing him in for dinner.   -If you say you don't want the unborn to "live off you" anymore then the only thing you can do is starve it because you can't kill it as it did nothing that it was not allowed to do until just now.   -You have decided the stranger must go, however, you don't have a right to kill him right there as you didn't give him any reasonable time to leave.
