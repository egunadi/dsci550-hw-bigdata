And I would like to know why that is. I asked the question in post #2 and got no answer. Are laypersons lacking in intelligence so much that it's hopeless for them to be on the same communication level with scientists? Since they share the same society, put their pants on one leg at a time in the same way, eat, sleep, and share economic processes in comparable ways, it seems to me it would be beneficial for them and laypersons both to understand each other when they use identical terms. (like the word, “theory”)
