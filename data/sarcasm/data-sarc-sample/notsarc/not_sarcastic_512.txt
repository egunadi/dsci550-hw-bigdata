Well it could mean simple instinct, and I think you will find it was only applied to animals with brains. EAM attributes "intelligence" even to bacteria and to corn plants, trees, jellyfish, single celled eukaryotes etc. If one is to consider intelligence the main driver of adaptation it must be omnipresent in living organisms - there is zero support for this concept.
