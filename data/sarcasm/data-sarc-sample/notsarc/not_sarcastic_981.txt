Intellignet design seems to have a large following. The fact that somebody believes in intellient design does not necessarily mean that they disagree with evolution. A lot of folks (I would say the majority) view it as evolution used as a vehicle for intellient design (basically "god planned it and made it all happen").   The movement to teach YEC is non existant. Creationism does not necessarily=YEC. The YEC crowd is their own little clique of scientific illiterates. I have been on the local board of education for 2 years now and have never heard the phrase "Young Earth Creationists" in any official capacity, nor has anybody ever suggested that it be taught. I had no idea what a "young earth creationist" was until I read it on this board, 6 months ago. It is simply not an issue, and I am right in the middle of Kansas.
