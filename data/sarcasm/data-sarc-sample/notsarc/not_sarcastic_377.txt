It stops us from saying we ara a rational people. I don't support any laws that would allow a father not to have a say so about his child being aborted. Are there any?? If it were a life or death thing for the mother no question.   As I stated I don't like the idea but making it illegal would simply put more unwanted kids in state homes. Lets take care of the living first!
