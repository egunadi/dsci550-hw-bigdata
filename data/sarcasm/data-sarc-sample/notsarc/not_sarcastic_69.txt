And your analysis is flat out lacking. What everyone else seems to realize is that the reason Obama won is because of FAR higher turnout, many by African American voters. (Who more tend to be ... taa daa! ... Democrats!) There is definitely a considerable discrepancy in Obama supporters and gay marriage supporters. Of that, there can be no doubt.   And your anaysis of the FL situation is completely removed from reality. FL requires a vote of over 60% for an amendment to pass. It wouldn't pass at 59%, let alone 50. So not only do you demonstrate a lack of even knowing what was needed there, it doesn't even fit as an apt comparison.
