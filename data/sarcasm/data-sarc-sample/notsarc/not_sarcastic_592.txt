Yes, it's very subjective. I was using evil as an example that was incorrectly used on the website. Even though evil is subjective, you can still be evil. (you can do evil to take away your goodness, but the only way to make yourself colder is by removing your heat, not adding "cold")   No, but there is proof that it's that way, which can be seen through a combination of personal experience and the experiences of others.   The classic example about seeing that the Earth is round is that of the horizon. Why do ships appear to sink as they approach it?
