You are exactly correct in regard to my intent. IMHO, the allegories of the Bible are meant to teach the spirit of the stories, not actual facts...just as Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny are meant to represent the spirit of the seasons. When we are young children, we tend to believe in Santa and Thumper because our parents play the game so well, then as we learn the truth, we put away the belief that they are real but we pass the spirit on to our own children by playing the same game with them.   AIMHO, God teaches us the spirit of creation with the inspired allegories written in the Bible. God created it all, He just did it in a fashion we will likely never fully understand.   AIMHO, there were thousands of Adams and Eves, created after an evolutionary process that started when God created all matter and time.   I'm not trying to warp the Bible at all, just as I would not try to warp the meaning of Santa Claus, even though I know he's not a jolly fat man living at the North Pole surrounded by elves and flying reindeer.
