You are getting to a more complicated area where "mental existence" no longer matters. I've explained earlier that it isn't exactly the same as "self defense" so I don't think a similiar response is needed. Furthermore, you are saying mental existence is not solely the thing that gives you value but rather it depends on outside influences and chance.   At some point it just seems like the stance on abortion is that the woman is more important no matter what. This is why I claim some will rank humans above other humans...a dangerous precedent which we have tried before.
