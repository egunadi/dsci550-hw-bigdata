You may see a vast differene, many do not. The "moral" grounds for many is simply the justification for their homophobia.   So now it's a massive nation wide government conspiracy to stifle free speech?   Canada stifles and oppresses religious freedom?   Honestly Jyoshu, where do you get this stuff?   This is utter BS, if you can find ANY proof of the Canadian gov't stifling free speech on this issue, religious freedom, or any other issue for that matter, please post it. If not, retract your BS statement, and admit that it's a fabrication.   I honestly don't think I underestimate it at all. I come across a very broad spectrum of people in my line of work, from one end of the scale to the other. The most common negative response I get is from those that are opposed to homosexuality in general and respond along the lines of "I don't like, I don't want to see it, but rights are rights, as long as it doesn't negatively affect me, I don't have a problem with it/I don't really care." I have come across a couple of people who were strongly opposed to the use of the term "marriage" but were fine with allowing homosexual "civil unions".   I think you overestimate how big of a "moral issue" this really is for most people.   Waxy
