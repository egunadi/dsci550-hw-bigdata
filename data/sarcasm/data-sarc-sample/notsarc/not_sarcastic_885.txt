Ingus, please see my comments at the end of my previous post.   The purpose of this thread is to introduce ourselves and have a Q&amp;A about the basis for each others views etc.   If you want to debate the specific differences we may have in our views, either open a new thread and invite me over, challenge me, whatever...   But I'm not going to debate it here.   I think this thread is a great idea.   People should introduce themselves, lay out their views however they see fit and let others do the same.
