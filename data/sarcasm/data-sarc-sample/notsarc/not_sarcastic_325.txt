It is rather disrespectful but don't think it is limited to one side. Most protestors on both sides aren't great.   one thing did spark my interest, and it is said often, why is it a "hard decision" if you are pro-choice? Is it hard because you don't know if you want a baby around or not? Couldn't this decision be just as hard before being pregnant? Even so, why link it to going to an abortion clinic? You hear "It was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place" but how is going through some protestors making this decision harder?   No one would admit to this but it is statements like "It was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place" that make me believe that someone realizes it is wrong and the struggle that makes it hard is whether or not to do the right thing or do they thing that would benefit you the most. And in that case, I agree...that can be a tough decision.
