This is different than stating that abortion is the same, in principle, as killing a born child. We are back on the question of "Why would someone do this horrible thing" which pro-life people continually ask and has been answered in many ways by many people. There are many threads on the subject   That the fetus did not come into existance by it's own choice is really irrelevant. That it did not cause problems of it's own actions does not mean that it does not cause problems.
