To a small extent, this happens already. Oftentimes (21.3%, U.S.), a woman decides to have and abortion because she cannot afford a baby (from here, source). This is in effect removing members of society who are non-productive (babies produce virtually nothing useful until they mature by about 10 years). And poor families are less productive, since they are often on welfare.   Granted, this is a rather harsh perspective, but the effect is the same: In the U.S., there are about (21.3% X 1.31 million) 280,000 less people every year who would have likely grown up in a poor home (assuming the child wouldn't have been adopted). Forced contraception/abortion is seen as an effective way of solving poverty in some parts of the world...
