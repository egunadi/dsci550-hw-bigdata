Like the docking simulation, in development there is a pre-existing fitness landscape (the womb). Both processes converge on similar endpoints each time it is run, both process are biased to a few endpoints and both processes reach local optima (e.g. skin cells) after the process id complete.   http://mybroadband.co.za/vb/picture....pictureid=1857   Figure 1: Similarities between development and a docking simulation employing a memetic algorithm.   There are certainly many parallels between our own designed simulated docking runs and the development of life.
