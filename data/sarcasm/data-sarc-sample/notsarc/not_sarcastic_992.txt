So your only link to gay rights and polygamy is a statement put out by a gay rights conference 30 years ago that does not EXPLAIN a link to polygamy, but shows it's support for it?   Hn ...   I'm with Justine on this one. This is a bit of a stretch.   It would be like me implying that your support for "traditional marriage" also supports spousal abuse just because marriages in the past allowed for wife beatings.
