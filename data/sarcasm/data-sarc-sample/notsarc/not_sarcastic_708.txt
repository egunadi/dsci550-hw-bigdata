would this be considered intelligent design? to me it would be like winding up a top, loading it with paint, and then letting it spin on paper to create a painting. the process is deliberately set in motion, but the painting itself is random and not deliberate. where the paint falls is not by design, even though the overall pattern would be.   anyway, to answer the question, there are lots of people who believe in a creator as well as evlution, so the beliefs are not mutually exclusive. the problem is that christianity depends upon the account of genesis being true. spontaneous origin is mutually exclusive to genesis, but evolution by itself is not necessarily. but evolution poses other problems such as the age of the earth and the existence of dinosaurs that creationists are stumped by.   in order to belief in evolution, you must, at the very least, disregard the genesis account. and disregarding genesis automatically invalidates christianity. but it doesnt necessarily invalidate the existence of a creator. pretty wierd, huh?
