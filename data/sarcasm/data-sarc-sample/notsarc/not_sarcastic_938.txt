And...   You're still left with the simple fact that the Declaration of Independance, the premise of your hierarchy of rhetoric, is not legally relevant to the government of the U.S.   The constitution was written after the declaration. Had they wanted to include wording from the declaration, they could have, yet they didn't, did they?   Your house of cards is built on a rhetorical slight of hand, trying to persuade by implying somehow that abortion being legal, which it is, in the U.S., right now, should not be allowed.   TIP: Trying forming a reasoned argument without such a weak premise, else, your entire argument is just as flawed, which it is.   Abortion is legal, for the right reasons.   A conscious, human, U.S. citizen, has rights.   Cells, without consciousnes, that are not citizens, do not have rights, are not individuals, and are not humans.   You can jump up and down, and post irrelevant things such as the Dec. of Independance, but it doesn't boost your debate credibility.   -Mach
