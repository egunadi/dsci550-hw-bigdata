Iangb, I would have thought that you would be intellectually honest enough to have (at least) accepted the fact that I have supported my claims.   I also thought that (by now) someone from your side of the abortion issue would step in (in this thread or by private message) and hold you to your claims of being 'intellectually honest.'   At this point, I actually have you questioning Planned Parenthood's definitions?   QUOTE;
