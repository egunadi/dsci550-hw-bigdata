Well, to say it has no mental existence doesn't really tell the whole story. The fetus WILL have (more than likely) full mental existence in a very short time. It seems to me that if you "view humanity with mental existance as important" you'd also view as important that the unborn baby WILL indeed reach that point, in all likelihood.
