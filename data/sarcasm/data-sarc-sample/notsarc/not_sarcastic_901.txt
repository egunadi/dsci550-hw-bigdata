Uh...yeah? Is there some other way than evolution this can happen? Evolution encompasses speciation which results from evolution taking different paths when populations are separated by some factor in their environment or geographically.   Are you saying you believe that the species have all somehow resulted from a common genome yet at the same time rejecting evolution as an explanation?
