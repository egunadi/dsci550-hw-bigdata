BWAHAHAHAHHAAH!   Innocent citizens are FIVE TIMES more likely to be mistakenly shot by a cop, than a cop even DELIBERATELY by a civilian!   Likewise, if my life is in danger, then I'm not really too worried about my lack of accountability to the person choosing to ENDANGER it; and I'm really sure if he's willling to commit armed murder then he's not too worried about misdemeanor gun-laws.   Psht, it's amazing how stupid, naive and arrogant these anti-gun XXXXXX are.   It's easy to get cute when someone ELSE'S life is on the line, but it's just plain evil to use the guns of the state, to take away someone ELSE'S guns and expose them to danger-- and particularly cowardly and hyopcrticial while cringing behind a safe neighborhood and lifestyle, while hiding from potential danger-- than shamelessly attacking those who simply fight BACK.
