To each his own...if you got it - flaunt it. Think of all the pretty, fashionable gun rigs that would spawn. Darn sinjin, you might have to get an outfit to get a date Course if you carried concealed like say, Mike Hammer, you might have to get a bowler or little CS hat?   Think of all the jobs it would create. Leather workers. Engravers. Gun finishes. More stylish guns. Corner gun stores and ammo at the local grocery, mail order business and on and on and on.   "Posers"? That is about all there is in kalifornia now isn't it? It doesn't bother you to watch scantily clad women...or men, whatever your preference is; why would full free exercise of a right freely stated in the Constitution be any different?   Oh, and on topic, end the pathetic pleas of the brady cowards and howls from VPC calling for discrimination and getting sued for demanding a Starbucks or any other emporium banish a citizen exercising a right.
