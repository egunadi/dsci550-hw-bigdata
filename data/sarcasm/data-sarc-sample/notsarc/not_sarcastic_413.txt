Why is it when Creo's don't believe something, Evo's always think because they have studies or what have you that we Creo's have to accept it as proof. I mean you don't accept anything as proof from Creo's. If Creo's did some carbon testing and did it accurately and got some anomaly's, you'd still reject it. I didn't lie not even by ignorance. I just don't believe it's true, but I take it I'm not allowed my beliefs . What fact has disproved my worldview, my worldview is intact as it ever has been?
