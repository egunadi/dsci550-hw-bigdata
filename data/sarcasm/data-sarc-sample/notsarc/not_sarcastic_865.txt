That clearly went whooshing over your head.   It was intended to mock the OP. (Interesting "new" bibilical revelation, indeed.)   I don't put any credence in silly comparisons like the trite Kennedy/Lincoln litany that arose in the 60's or the similarly absurd list that INRI posted. They both demonstrate how one can concoct meaningless comparisons in an attempt to invent a non-existent connection between two unrelated events.   It is the same for all "prophesies".
