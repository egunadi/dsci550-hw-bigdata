No Archie I wouldn't dare do anything sexual outside of the missionary position without a ring on my finger... As far as superior or better umm no Archie. As a governor of a state he has to be for all peoples not just the ones that fund his campaign.. Unless of course the constitution is flawed and there's a tiny little clause excluding him from upholding all aspects of the document.   And once again YOUR god commanded Archie not America's god or every person on this planet. Don't you understand that there is a separation between church and state? Or did you throw that out the window too?   Oh and the state of Texas is making school children take a bible class. Doesn't matter if the kids an atheist or agnostic or doesn't believe in it or was raised differently their still making them read it.   Way to go Texas for overstepping the boundaries of church and state...   But no Archie I'm merely stating that this nut doesn't consider gays or lesbians equal peoples under the law where they need protection. Doesn't matter that I can pull up thousands of incidents of hate crimes due to a persons sexual orientation, doesn't matter that Gay and Lesbian teens are harassed up to the point of suicide let alone god forbid their allowed to even have rights.   Point being is a public official elected to serve and protect all peoples under the law for the common good has stated just to do the opposite..
