So you would go with the unknowable argument?   Well then this is applicable to your response:   So now you have said that god is undefinable or often said "supernatural".   T:I believe in God   A:What is God?   T:I dont know.   Then my question to you would be that if you dont know what God is... then what is it that you believe in?
