Hmm . . . funny, I don't remember ever hearing a pro-lifer say that pregnancy was a wonderful snuggly thing or the best thing in the world. What I do see is pro-lifers like myself wondering why pregnancy is protrayed (in the form of a generalization) as so horrible by people such as yourself who just described it as "unbelievably" hard to go through, or a "life threatening condition" like malignant cancer. You didn't qualify it by saying "some" pregnancies are life threatening or unbearable. Maybe yours was, but how can you say that for every woman in the world? I know for a fact that my wife's pregnancy was not "unbelievably hard to go through"--she's told me otherwise and I believe her. Sorry, but I believe my wife over you.   What you did was use unfounded generalizations, which is exactly the sort of thing this thread is about.
