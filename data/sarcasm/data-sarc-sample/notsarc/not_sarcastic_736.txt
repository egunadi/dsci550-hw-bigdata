Well ... I don't think it's a light choice for anyone. (Although I'd imagine, for someone who might be developmentally disabled, for example, it might not mean as much. And I suppose some may not care at all.) I don't think it's a decision women necessarily struggle over, either, however. Nor should they. For many women, the course of action that they need to take is quite clear.   That is, whether or not someone 'should' have a difficult time with this decision, I don't agree. And, I don't think women's motivations in getting abortions, or their personal behavior ITO becoming pregnant are anyone else's concern. Or even if they do have an abortion *blithely*. (Distinguishing from policies about public health education.)   I just think people have to do what's right for them. Finding that or reaching a decision -- well, people are different and have different lives. They have different understandings of biology, different health issues, different relationships, different economic positions, different religious views, or none at all. The circumstances around the pregnancy, different.   I don't agree with the "potentiality" issue either. If *someone* isn't there *yet*, they're not in existence, period. I think there's just an understandable human reaction to the beginning of life being taken. It's not "potential" life. It's life all right. But there's no individual except in our imaginations.   To me, viability, sentience, the development of the nervous system and the brain, and the experience of pain in a fetus during the third trimester begin to mark the ethical boundaries. But those, too, as indicators, are not absolute. And the woman comes first. It's between her and her physician. It's not my job to judge whether she suffered appropriately enough or not. And I don't think anyone should have go through any demonstrative motions one way or the other for the anti-abortion camp. It's none of their business.
