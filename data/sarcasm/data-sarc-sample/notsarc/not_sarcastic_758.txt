Oh sorry, I didn't understand what you were asking.   Ok, what I think happened {Like Tasyfish hinted at} was that Moses recorded what god told him or Genesis 1 because it is in more detail, and Genesis 2 is what was passed down through Noah, in Oral history, so it would differ slightly, but that's becaue of man's error, not God's.
