What a condescending attitude you have. In case you haven't noticed, you are a very small part of the human race that you smuggly hold in contempt. (Thankfully small!) Your mission should be to improve it, not to stand back and claim you are better than everybody else, as you seem to do.   Killing innocent people of any age is wrong. Children are no exception, they are just the epitomy of innocence.   The "pretty sick" applies to your own deluded thoughts.   Rest assured, I will not mourn your death or the deaths of any of those you may have taught your insane values. You are  !
