Well, kind of a boring thread, since everyone agrees, but since I'm new here, I may as well weigh in. Hubby and I have three grown kids and one teen. The grown ones all got the same going-to-college gifts. They got a safe car, a laptop, an emergency credit card, and a personal firearm. I felt this especially important for our daughters.
