This was a comment on the physics book that has biographies of great physicists that were Bible believing christians. Right. Many believed in alchemy (they were wrong), harmful effects of night air (they were wrong), spontaneous growth of maggots from rotting meat (they were wrong), rats arising from grain (they were wrong), and the Bible (they were wrong). If it is important that Newton believed in the Bible, why isn't it as important that he believed in alchemy and did not believe in the divinity of Christ.   There isn't any such thing as science from a Christian perspective. Either it is science, or it isn't.   You claimed to have studied evolution. You didn't. Why would you tell us that you did?
