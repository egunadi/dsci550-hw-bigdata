No, I think you're trying to do more than that. You're trying to say that the increase in crime is due to a lack of gun ownership, aren't you? Because if you are, the article you cite doesn't back up that claim.   What, no actual data to back up any of your claims? Do you have access to US crime numbers? How many armed breakins do you get in a country where people do have guns? That's the comparison that needs to be made here.
