I believe this is wrong. But this is a private company, and if they want to discriminate based on religion, that's fine, just as a church may outlaw atheists. Do I agree with it? No. But does it have to do with our debate? No. This is about the science classroom. Also, again abiogenesis is a hypothesis, the same level as ID.
