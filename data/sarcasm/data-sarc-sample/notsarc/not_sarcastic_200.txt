I'd say no to the first part, and yes to the second. The "information theory" argument is something that gets brought up on forums alot, generally by people who don't know what information theory is, but I've never seen an "official" ID person claim it as a central argument.   The basic argument is that stuff, from the universe, to people, to eyeballs, to DNA, is too complex to have "just happened". Someone, (and they won't say God, cause their not trying to be religious here, oh no...) must have designed them.
