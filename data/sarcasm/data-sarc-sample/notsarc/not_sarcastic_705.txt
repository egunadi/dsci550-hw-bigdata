You know, I would be fine with that as long as it were truly a middle ground. If that term were used equally among straights as well as gays.   But it's just a term. The same as with the term "marriage."   It's just a term. Just a word.   Personally I feel the government needs to get out of the business of marriage altogether.   Let the legal term be agreed upon unilaterally.
