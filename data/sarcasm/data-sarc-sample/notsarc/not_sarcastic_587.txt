Well, I am a creationist, and I would hope I can think logically (it's generally a good quality for an accountant and tax attorney to have). The difference between microevolution and evolution as an explanation for the beginning of a species is simple. In microevolution a species is simply adapting to it's environments. In evolution as is usually meant by the word you are talking about the formation of an entirely new creature from inorganic compounds. If this is possible I pose a few questions for you.   1) Why have no new creatures evolved from inorganic compounds in human memory?   2) How did these inorganic compounds decide that some creatures should evolve, while others of the same species did not? Why are there not some apes that have evolved into humans by now? Why didn't all apes evolve into humans?   3) One of my favorite pieces of confusion from evolutionists involve fossils. How do you know how old a fossil is? Every evolutionist I have asked has stated that fossils are dated by the rock layer they are found in, but if you then ask them how the rock layer is dated they answer that it is dated by the fossils that where discovered in it! That's a classical example of circular reasoning.   I am not a scientist, so I cannot present all the evidence against evolution as clearly as someone with a scientific education and background might do.
