I am hardly a phyicist, but I am under the impression that there is at least some people who feel there is reason that there are 'uncaused causes'. I think that   the terms used are 'Vacuum flucuations', and 'virtual particles'. I am not aware   of any peer reviewed articles on it , but a popular press book is 'Achilles in the quantum world' by Richard Morris.
