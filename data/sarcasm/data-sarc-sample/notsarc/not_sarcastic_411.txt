You still don't get it. How many times does it have to be explained to you? Populations evolve. No change of any kind in a single organism is evolution. Evolution is the changes in the hereditary (genetic) makeup of populations over time.   You continue to display your ignorance. Evolution is a process that takes place in living things. Just because all of science contradicts your childish belief in mythology doesn't mean that all science is evolution. Because cosmology contradicts your mythology, it must be evolution. Because astronomy contradicts your mythology, it must be evolution. Because geology contradicts your mythology, it must be evolution.   And that is why creationists are such scary people. Their morality comes from a book and threats of eternal punishment. The fundamentalist christian morality is so shallow that they are unable to conceive that others can actually have a higher morality based on self respect.   And that is meaningless babble. Evolution is a process that has been observed whether you like it or not. It is not a moral statement nor is it a statement of faith. It does not deal with government, laws or culture. Whining about it won't change it.
