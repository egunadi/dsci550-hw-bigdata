The definition of manslaughter is when one's actions, which end up killing someone, display a reckless disregard for the dangers of the situation. That's not a proper legal definition, but it'll do.   Now, you want to argue that pro-lifers would be forced into the counterintuitive conclusion that ALL miscarriage is manslaughter, and thus their position is ridiculous. I'm saying that they would only be forced to admit that a very small portion of miscarriage is manslaughter, and a portion that they would probably be willing to make a case for.   I'm not saying "miscarriage is not manslaughter," but only "miscarriage is not always manslaughter." For example, if a woman took perfectly good care of herself and did nothing dangerous, but had a miscarriage anyway, she would obviously not have committed manslaughter. If a woman had one drink with dinner, but she was carrying a very unhealthy fetus and it died, then she would not have committed manslaughter, because that was not reckless. I pointed out the "you-shouldn't-be-drinking-and-having-unprotected-sex" argument as a position somebody might hold, but I think that it would probably be judged as unrepresentative of the definition of manslaughter.   So obviously, miscarriage cannot be manslaughter in the sense of "every instance of A is an instance of B."
