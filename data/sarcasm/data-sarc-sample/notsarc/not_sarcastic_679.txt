The Brady Campaign whines more than they act. Making handguns legal in Chicago wouldn't make them happy. Sending the national guard in wouldn't make them happy. They don't have a solution for the problem, but they're right there to whine about it.   They're just like the Federal Government; they find something simple and complicate it.
