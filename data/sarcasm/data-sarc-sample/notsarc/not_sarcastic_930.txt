Is it correct to assume that in the presence of the precursors of the standard genetic code (e.g. intermediates of glucose degradation and the citric acid cycle), the intimate relationship between these molecules resulted in the inevitable organization of the genetic code (global optimum of the system)?   Articles 5-7   These articles discuss fascinating mathematical representation of the genetic code. For example, in article 6 a representation of the genetic code as a sixâ€“dimensional Boolean hypercube is proposed.   Abstract:
