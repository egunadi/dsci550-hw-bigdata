You not differentiating between the beaver and the beaver dam, the bird and the bird's nest or the man and the man's truck. The dams, nests and truck do not occur naturally...they are constructed by the naturally occuring animals using materials that occur in nature (albeit we have to smelt the iron and vulcanize the rubber whilst the birds and beavers just stick stuff together).
