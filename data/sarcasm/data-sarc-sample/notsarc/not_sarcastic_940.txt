Look over the Heller ruling again. All nine judges agreed unanimously that the Second Amendment protected a right that was wholly individual in nature. The only disagreement was whether the right still applied today.   And no, the individual states and cities shouldn't be allowed to set their own standards for a constitutional right, that flies in the face of the 14th Amendment. And worse, you're arguing for precedent that would basically allow the various states to not respect your other rights; they could ban the shirt you choose to wear because it's offensive to some small, insignificant minority somewhere.
