Technically, all syllogisms need two premises, first of all.   "Step two" and "step three" were a dilemma, not separate steps. Learn to read.   Dilemma:   You only read Scenario 1, which was:   step two -God can create a rock he cannot lift -   Step three - God cannot lift the rock   conclusion - God is not all powerful   Scenario Two was   - God cannot create such a rock   - Therefore, there is something God cannot do   - Therefore, God is not all-powerful   The only case in which God could truly be all-powerful is if he can somehow both create an unbreakable rock and then break it, which defies the Law of Non Contradiction and is thus absurd. Thus, the notion of all-powerfulness, which leads to such a notion, is also absurd.
