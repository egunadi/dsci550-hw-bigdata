Well, that just means I'm a more capable lump of cells now than I was when I was first conceived. I started doing what most embryos do when they are first formed, and that is develop. I'm still developing. I can't seem to stop it. I think my body has stopped growing (in height anyway), but seem to keep filling my brain with more and more experience.   The point I was trying to make is that since there is a continuum of existence between conception and death, there is no line you can draw (save birth, which may or may not be considered an arbitrary boundary to personhood) that would constitute some sort of a change in what you are.   I started as one cell and continued to grow and develop, which I am still doing now. If I am a person now, I was a person when I was the zygote.   If we are going to talk about aortion in this society we should be honest about it and not try to mince words when it come to killing a baby. I'm not "anti-choice" but I think we should honestly recognize that an embryo is a living human individual that dies when it is aborted. That thought turns most people off so they have to make themselves believe that an abortion is not a killing since the embryo wasn't a person. Logically, it is a killing. A life was ended. The question then becomes, is it murder? I don't happen to think that, but it is really quite subjective anyway.
