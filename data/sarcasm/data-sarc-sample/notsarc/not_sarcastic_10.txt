In a way, taking rights away is an American value since we have prescribed methods for doing it. For instance, we have legislatures which posess authority to remove a large number of what you likely consider to be rights. Here are just a small number that come to mind:   1) Right to murder   2) Right to own slaves   3) Right to rape   4) Right to abusing children   5) Right to vote   6) Right to smoke (if you're under 18)   7) Right to drink (18th Amendment)   8) Right to engage in certain activities in public   9) Right to drive as fast as one wants   10) Right to dump dangerous chemicals in the nearest river   The list goes on really. The fact is that you don't object to taking rights away in principle, you only object to taking away those rights that you wish to retain. That is quite inconsistent.   Where do you get the idea that one has a right to perform an abortion anyway?
