When will it stop? Never. They will take every gun, every toy gun, disarm the law enforcment community, give us Nerf batons so we don't actually hurt the criminals, and say that this kinder gentler way of doing things will help. In the meantime murders will go through the roof, like in Australia, rape will escalate, breaking and entering will become common place, and cops will die by the minute. They will not only confiscate the guns, but then charge the owners of those guns for being terrorists. It won't end. In order to establish true dependency upon a government you must force the populous to rely completely on the government for every aspect of life including safety.
