So a free society is one where the goverment does not have tabs on their citizens? How could then the goverment work when it does not know who they actually govern? The foundation of economics is that you have correct data, else it´s the beginning of corruption not freedom.   And since when was there a dichotomy between freedom and socialism?   Further how does the usage of identification ease the rounding up of suspects? Wouldn´t it be rather MORE risk to be rounded up if you couldn´t identify yourself and thus automatically become suspect than be able to and take yourself out of the calculation?
