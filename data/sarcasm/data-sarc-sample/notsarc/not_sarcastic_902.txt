I think I, and the other members of what I'll call the "scientific community", must be masochists of sorts as well, we continually return to these threads and bang our heads against minds that are stone walls - completely impervious to reason or logic.   I think, no, I know, that there are two main reasons why I return to these threads. The first one is simple, I'm amazed at the scientific illiteracy of the average YEC, especially when science is often their justification for belief.   The second and major reason is simply my fascination with how the mind of the Creationist works. Their desperation to justify their faith is so powerful it drives them to completely abandon mainstream science and logic in favour of an isolated coccoon of reality. The insecurity in their faith that the entire pseudoscience of creationism betrays is the most ironic part.   As you say, most quickly realize that they're in over their heads, that what they've been told in their churches doesn't stand up to scrutiny in the real world. So, rather than continuing down a path that will bring them no good, they retreat and bury their heads in the comforting sand of "not knowing any better". However, there always seems to be one or two that are so deeply entrenched, that they simply can't retreat, they've got too much invested.   The psychology, more than the science, is fascinating to me.   Waxy
