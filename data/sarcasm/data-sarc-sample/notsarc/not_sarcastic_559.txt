you're looking at evolution in way too much of a magical and mystical way. Evolution doesn't "know" anything. It doesn't have any desires... and... i lack the eloquence to briefly state mechanical (and complete lack of desire) aspects of evolution. i suggest you do research as to how there are no conscious thinking elements in evolution.   Science will never be able to disprove any god because of some flaw science happens to point out. The best individuals can do is, when people try to reason that such perfect organs imply a designer, point out that the design isn't all that perfect after all.   If you want to try and debate flaws in design are evidence against a god... well go ahead... but then i'll just know if i'm ever looking for an easy debate victory i'll just try to find you. At the very best all you are doing is showing that the idea that God created all things perfectly probably isn't true... and even then someone can just point out that apparent flaws we see are simply the ineffable will of god.
