If a child comes in for an abortion and fears abuse from her parents then law enforcement should be notified. The only people protected by opposing notification laws are abusers and pedophiles. No elective, invasive medical proceedure should be performed on a child without the consent of a parent or judge.   If a minor is allowed to have an abortion without consent the parents/ guardians will have no idea whats been done to this child should complications arise, they wouldn't be able to give this information to a ER doctor or the childs pediatrition.
