Reasonable people would look for justification for their beliefs.   Many who have beliefs based on faith, however, accept things because they feel like accepting them. Including, absolute truths, and contradictions.   The resultant SHOULD be peaceful acceptance because after all, they can both be correct, yet be in contradiction, according to faith-based belief systems. The reality would probably be, as you say, that they would mix up faith and reason and start claiming one is "actually correct", and the other is "The work of the devil", and proceed to clobber the other religion, absorb their members, abordb the traditions that were "popular" from the other religion, rename them and re-color them to match their religion, and carry on proclaiming truth and the afterlife and mercy and whatever else pops into their heads.   That's of course, based on what I've seen and read.   -Mach
