No, I'm saying it's OK because abortion is legal in this country. I was just pointing out that it's also legal to execute a convicted killer, and it's fine and dandy to declare wars where many people will die. "Thall shalt not kill, unless there is a war".   Legally there is a difference. But let's just toss that out for a second. The end result is exactly the same. Eyes fogged over no longer care whether it was fun or self defense.   It's only time it's your call, is when it's suicide.
