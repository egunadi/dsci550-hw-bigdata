Nobody I know sanctions adultery. There are already serious consequences built in against it. As far a same sex marriage, I know of nobody that is suggesting legal penalties for it unless one considers the refusal to legally recognize it a legal penalty. Certainly nobody has been jailed or fined for attempting such marriages. Privately performed ceremonies as such are not punished.
