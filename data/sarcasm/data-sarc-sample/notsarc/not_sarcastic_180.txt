I think you need to look up euthanasia, and not only for the correct grammar. Those examples are not euthanasia. Abortion is not the same thing as euthanasia.   Why don't you just say what is on your mind, rather than setting these ham-handed traps you hope someone will fall into? It is clear what your opinion is. If you have something to say, by all means express yourself.
