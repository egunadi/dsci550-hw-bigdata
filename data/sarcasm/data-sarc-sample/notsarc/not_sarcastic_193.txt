But I don't hear you saying things like "baseball is always harmful to the player" or "baseball is something no one should have to go through."   You see, if pro-choicers only used the 'pregnancy-is-bad-if-forced argument, they might have a point, but they often don't add the last part.   Besides, no one ever forces a woman to get pregnant in the first place.
