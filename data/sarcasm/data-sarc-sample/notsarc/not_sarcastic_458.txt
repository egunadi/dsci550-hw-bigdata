He has a bit more basic information about R.A.T.E. on his webpage.   TO also has a page critiquing R.A.T.E. methodology.   Sorry, I know you're looking for more substantial personal feedback, but this is some good basic information that doesn't rely upon a billion links.   You also might consider asking this question on iidb.org, and maybe Dr. Meert will respond to you personally.   More importantly, let us not get hung up on analyzing the raw empirical data only. For example, if I use a stopwatch to time how long it takes for light to flood the room after I turn on the switch, and I come up with 0.06s, you can't argue with my empirical data: I timed it at 0.06s. The fact that human response time is comparatively lousy and that a stopwatch is awful for extremely short time intervals is more significant that the stopwatch reading itself. This is the primary error that R.A.T.E. makes.
