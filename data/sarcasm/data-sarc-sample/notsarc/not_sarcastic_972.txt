Really, then show me how I'm wrong - without dogmatic statements. I would suggest, given the fact that you feel the need to ignore science, deny obvious facts of reason, and cling to evolutionary theory, that it is you that has the problem with religion - your naturalistic religion. I would further suggest that you stop attibuting your personal opinions to science, and start calling your comments what they really are, personal opinion.   -By the way, is everyone who disagrees with you promoting a "religious agenda?" Where have I leaned on religion to make my point? And what makes you think that I need religion to defeat your postion as I have here? I've used science, scientific journals, and good sound reasoning to defeat your comments. I suggest you rethink what you're saying. It sure sounds like you're the one with the "religious agenda."
