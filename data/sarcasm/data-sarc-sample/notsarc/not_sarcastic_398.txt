Just on my way out, saw this, and YES! I have long believed that this is the heart of the matter, and have tried to make this point with little success from time to time.   I have never seen a direct response to this. Ever. Even in threads where the discussion has carried on in detail on both sides, this concept is totally ignored.   There was a similar, brief hiatus leaning towards this point in one of the threads over at IIDB where creationist spammer Afdave is rapidly losing his dignity and proving himself predictably ignorant in all fields of science including the philosophy of same.   It got really interesting for a bit and the guys over there looked to have actually got through to him for a bit, but then he predictably went into full Gish Gallop mode in order to bury his own cognitive dissonances underneath wave upon wave of standard AiG/EvoFairytale strawmen.   Just my two pence; this is a fascinating psychological point that should be discussed.
