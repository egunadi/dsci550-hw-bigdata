Well I ####,moan,and bitch about it to and I know I can't prove anything,but do'nt logic say an AK47 ASSAULT RIFLE not semi auto but the real deal is going to cost hundreds less south of their border,Know doubt the same for an M16.Also you don't have to worry about smuggling them in as much if at all.Besides it getting harder all the time to get your ASSAULT RIFLES(you know the full auto type)not to mention hand grenades and rpgs at your corner gun shop anymore.Oh yeah less not forget the gun shows,and all there loop holes.   Jus a thought.
