If logic was invented by man that would mean that when people did not exist neither did logic. That does not sound logical to me. Most people believe there is life eleswhere in the universe (I'm not saying I do but I just want to illustrate a point). If logic was invented by man does that mean aliens elsewhere in the universe do not have logic to guide them?   Just a question.   "In Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge." (Colossians 2:3)
