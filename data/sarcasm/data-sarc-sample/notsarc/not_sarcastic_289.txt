So you know how foolish you are and hope that name calling will distract from that being recognized by everyone. Erectus skulls were smaller because the brain was smaller. You brought up KNM-WT 15000 (Turkana Boy) and you weren't even aware that as an adult he would have been about 6'1" tall? Why is his skull smaller than modern humans?
