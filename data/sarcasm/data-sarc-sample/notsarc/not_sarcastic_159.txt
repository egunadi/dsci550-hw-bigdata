How is that silly? You do realize that the vast majority of firearms used in crimes are stolen no? And many of those are stolen from legal buyers. While it is a poor argument to argue that firearms should be banned for that primary reason, the underlying principle of control over supply is hardly silly. Unless you think that control over nuclear weapons is silly. Maybe you would. After all, you are Isly.
