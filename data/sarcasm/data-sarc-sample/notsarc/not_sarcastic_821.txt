yes, on the grounds of "mostly likely" we can make reasonable assumptions. but we must still treat them as such.   part of the catch of God's existence is that no evidence of his existence cn ever be found. if Jesus actually physically performed observable miracles, even 2000 years ago, then it would surely proven that the supernatural can and does (or did) exist in reality. however, even jesus's ministry contradicts the faith theory. how can God expect faith from those who haven't observed on the grounds of those who have? if people can observe the manifested power of God in reality, then they have physical evidence that God exists. but this conflicts with the nature of God from a biblical standpoint. in other words, the bible cannot claim that physical evidence for the existence of God can exist, and then that it cannot exist, without contradicting itself. what we end up with is the predicament that ANY physical evidence that could possibly support God's existence is evidence against God's existence (at least from a biblical standpoint)
