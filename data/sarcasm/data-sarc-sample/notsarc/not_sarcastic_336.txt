Microevolution has occured. Several times over and recorded in the lab and the natural world.   [quote] Give me one peer reviewed paper . Just one. Not the latest dogma from talk origins . 29 evidences for bs.[quote]   Huh. Guess you're wrong.   [quote]Talk Origins does your thinking not mine. Give me peer reviewed documents not the latest political/religious factions babblings. Of course they don't exist but how could they? [quote]   And how does that mean evolution is wrong and creation is correct?   You do realize that even if you somehow manage to prove evolution false (not likely), you are still miles from proving creation right?
