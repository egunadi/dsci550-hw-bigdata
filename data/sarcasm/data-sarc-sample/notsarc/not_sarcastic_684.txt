Thanks. But it seems that you don't understand. Perhaps the people of Austin are more intelligent than they are down here in Houston. Maybe it's just that you are surrounded by educated people who show a tendency away from creationism. But you see, I run into people all the time (and meet them on this board too) who think that speciation has never been observed. Why do they think that? Because their holy book tells them so. The herring gull/lesser black-backed gull is an example of a single, vast, globe encircling population that has become separate species at the extremes of it's range - and those extremes overlap. Before I came to Texas the idea that the Book of Genesis was literally true never occurred to me. So it was kind of a neat moment to realize that the big birds around the restaurant dumpster were herring gulls, a living example of a population in the process of forming separate species.
