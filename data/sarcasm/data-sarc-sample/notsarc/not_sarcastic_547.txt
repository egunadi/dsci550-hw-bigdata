Then should not your challenge be re-worded to say "What might be the best..."   Because at present we are not at a stage where by we know everything about 'pain' therefore in the current climate, rather than what might be known down the track, I think I have met the majority of your challenge. After-all, you are insisting now on what 'you can measure', and we can't measure all that there is about pain, at present.
