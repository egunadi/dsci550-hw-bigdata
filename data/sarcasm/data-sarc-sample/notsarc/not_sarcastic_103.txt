Since I was there, I'll give you an objective rundown:   1.) Dawkins didn't "crash" anything. He watched the movie without saying a word and participated in a Q&amp;A session with the producer at the end --a session that the producer deliberately started.   2.) There was no "sneaking" on any level. PZ, his daughter, and I all registered our names over the internet for the event and selected the option to have up to three guests come with us. We registered our real names, our real addresses, our real telephone numbers, and our real emails, and we all received confirmation emails approving our registration.   3.) What possible reason did they have to deny PZ a viewing of the film? Dawkins and I pressed the producer Mathis on this issue, and he said it was about money -- he wanted PZ to come back in a month and pay his $10. But this makes no sense. PZ was paid $1,200 for his interview. They thanked him for the interview in the credits. If money was a concern, they could have paid him $1,190 and given him a free reservation. Just the fact that he was in the film should have been enough to warrant a seat at a pre-screening event.   This all begs the question: What in God's name are they so bloody afraid of?
